  4 27    1.  As used in this section:
  4 28    a.  "Intellectually disabled" means the same as defined in
  4 29 section 902.15.
  4 30    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 31 defined in section 902.15.
  4 32    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 27    1.  As used in this section:
  4 28    a.  "Intellectually disabled" means the same as defined in
  4 29 section 902.15.
  4 30    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 31 defined in section 902.15.
  4 32    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 28    a.  "Intellectually disabled" means the same as defined in
  4 29 section 902.15.
  4 30    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 31 defined in section 902.15.
  4 32    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 29 section 902.15.
  4 30    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 31 defined in section 902.15.
  4 32    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 30    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 31 defined in section 902.15.
  4 32    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 31 defined in section 902.15.
  4 32    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 32    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 33 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 34 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      4 35 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  1 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  2 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  3 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  4 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  5 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual

  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,

  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without

  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  6 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  7 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a

  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section

  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without

  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5  8 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  9 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:

  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be

  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.

  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court

  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 10 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled, the
  5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 11 defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder,
  5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a

  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive

  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 12 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be
  5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 13 sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment
  5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a

  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 14 in the manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the
  5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 15 court that the evidence presented by the defendant at the
  5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties

  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the

  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme

  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 16 hearing does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty
  5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 17 under this section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the
  5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 18 introduction of evidence of intellectual disability or mental
  5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 19 illness during the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds
  5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 20 that evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness
  5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 21 does not preclude imposition of the death penalty, evidence of
  5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the

  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating

  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not

  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the

 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 22 intellectual disability or mental illness may be reviewed by
  5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 23 the jury in the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be
  5 24 informed of the finding in the initial proceeding at any time
  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,

  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.

  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

  5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of

  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 25 during the penalty proceeding.
  5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness

  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such

  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section

 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.

 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 26    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense of
  5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been

  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 27 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the
  5 28 state intends to request that the death penalty be imposed
  5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as

  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness

  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating

  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,

  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is

  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless

  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the

  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the

  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 29 under section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of
  5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of
  5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by

 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any

 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 30 intent to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of

  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under

  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating

  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner

  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 31 the information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 32    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,

  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and

  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 33 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 34 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious

  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the

  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not

  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without

  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.

  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      5 35 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  1 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  2 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,

  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:

  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  3 and sexual abuse under section 902.15.
  6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  4    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  5 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to, an
  6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  6 offense other than the multiple offense of murder, kidnapping,
  6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  7 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  8 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6  9 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 10 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 11    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of,
  6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 12 or the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of
  6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 13 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but
  6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 14 the prosecuting attorney waives the death penalty, the court
  6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 15 shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance
  6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 16 with the sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal
  6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual

  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness

  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:

  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the

  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 17 procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909,
  6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 18 which are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the
  6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any

 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 19 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse.
  6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as

  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section

  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties

  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 20    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 21 multiple offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under
  6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the

  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,

  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties

  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the

  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating

  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that

  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 22 section 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the
  6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 24 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 23 initial proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive

  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted

  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel

  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the

  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 25 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 26    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 27 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder,
  6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a

 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.

  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 28 kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned
  6 29 in the initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held
  6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In

  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 30 to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 31 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 32 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section

  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness

  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:

  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult

  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,

  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by

  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      6 33 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 34 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 35 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  2 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  3 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7  1 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In

  7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the

  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating

  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or

  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7  4 follows:
  7  5    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  6 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7  7 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  8 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  9 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.

  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 10 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 11 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of
  7 12 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each

  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 13 including but not limited to evidence relating to the life of
  7 14 the victim and the impact of the loss of the victim to the
  7 15 victim's family and society.
  7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 16    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 17 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 18 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused

 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the

  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without

  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the

 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.

  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating

  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if

  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 19 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 20 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 21 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:

  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,

  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or

  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously

  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme

  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult

  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and

  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The

  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 22 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 23    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 24 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 25 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any

 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as

  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal

  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The

  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by

  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns

  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.

  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult

  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 26    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 27 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 28 defense.
  7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also

 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a

 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:

  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not

  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the

 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a

 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 29    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 32 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 30    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 31 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by

  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.

  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      7 33 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 34 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 35    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  8  1 criminal activity.
  8  2    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  3 substantial domination of another person.
  8  4    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  5 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse and the
  8  6 defendant did not intend to kill or anticipate that lethal
  8  7 force would be used.
  8  8    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence

  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,

  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the

 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns

 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded

  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and

  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended

  8  9 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and

  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The

  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously

 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a

 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns

 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court

 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any

  8 10    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8 11 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 12 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 13 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if

  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a

 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.

  8 14 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 15 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 16 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 17 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 18    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 19 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 20 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 21 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:

  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not

  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life

  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not

  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.

  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns

 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.

 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      8 22 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 23 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 24    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 25 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  8 26 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The

  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life

  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the

  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      8 27    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      8 28    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 23    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a
 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or
 10 11 the court returns unanimous affirmative findings on each of the
 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 17 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      8 29 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 32 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.

  9 24 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a
 10  8 reckless indifference to human life, the court shall enter a

 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life

 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each

 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      8 30 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 31 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,

 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a

 10  9 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 10 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1, even if the jury or

 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 34 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 35    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended

  8 33 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 34 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 35 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  9  1 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  5 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.

  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 30 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously
 10  3 determines, or the court if there is no jury, finds that a
 10  4 preponderance of evidence exists that shows that the defendant
 10  5 was not a major participant in the commission of the multiple
 10  6 offense of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section
 10  7 902.15, and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a

 10 12 issues submitted under subsection 6.
 10 13    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 14 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 15 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 16 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life

 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.

 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any

 11  1 to read as follows:
 11  2      9  2 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  3 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  4 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not

  9  6 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  7 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  8 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  9    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9 10 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9 11 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 12 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 13 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 14 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 15 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 16 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 17 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 18    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 19 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 20 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 21    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 22 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.

  9 25 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 26    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 27 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 28 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 29 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

  9 31    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 32 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 33 of murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse under section 902.15,
  9 34 and that the defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless
  9 35 indifference to human life is presented to the jury, or the
 10  1 court if there is no jury, the jury or the court shall also
 10  2 return a special verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously

 10 18    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 19 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 20 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 21 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 22 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 23 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 24 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 25 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 26 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 27 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 28 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 29 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 30 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 31 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 32 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 33 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of

 18 27    Sec. 17.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect January 1,
 18 28 2018.
 18 29    Sec. 18.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to offenses

 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.

 18 29    Sec. 18.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to offenses
 18 30 committed on or after the effective date of this Act.
 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a

 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced

 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically

 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in

 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 18 30 committed on or after the effective date of this Act.
 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The

 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.

 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect

 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or

 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence

 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.

 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect

 18 28 2018.
 18 29    Sec. 18.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to offenses
 18 30 committed on or after the effective date of this Act.
 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of

 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced

 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under

 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The

 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.

 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would

 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 35 committed on or after that date.

 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest

 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or

 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of

 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or

 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences

 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a

 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence

 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not

 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 35 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 19  1 first degree, kidnapping, and sexual abuse committed by a
 19  2 person age 18 or older with respect to the same victim who is a
 19  3 minor if the trial jury, or the judge if there is no jury, makes
 19  4 specific findings and whether the jury believes the defendant
 19  5 should be put to death in a separate penalty proceeding held
 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in

 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have

 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.

 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when

 19  6 after the close of the initial trial proceeding.  Under the
 19  7 bill, a death sentence could be imposed if the murder would
 19  8 constitute murder in the first degree and the state pleads and
 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial

 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the

 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.

 19  9 proves the defendant also kidnapped and committed sexual abuse
 19 10 against the murder victim who was a minor.
 19 11    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19 12 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19 13 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19 14 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 15 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 16 indifference to human life.
 19 17    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.
 21 33    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 34 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses

 19 18 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 19 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 20 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 21 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 22 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 23 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 24 persons who may be executed.
 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 22 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 23 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 24 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 25 sentence of death.
 21 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 32 mandate included in the bill.

 19 25    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 26 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 27 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 29 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 30 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 21  5 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  6 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),

 19 28 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or

 19 31 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 32 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 33    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 34 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 35 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 20  1 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 20  2 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 20  3 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 20  4 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 20  5 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  6 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  7 litigants.
 20  8    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  9 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20 10 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20 11 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20 12 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20 13 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20 14 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 15 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 16 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 17 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 18 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 19 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 20 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 21 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 22 murder, kidnapping, and sexual abuse; and the defendant's
 20 23 character or record or the circumstances of the offense.  The
 20 24 sentencing proceeding is conducted separately from the finding
 20 25 of guilt or innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 26    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 27 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 28 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 29 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 30 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 31 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 32 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 33 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 34 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 35 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 21  1 The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 21  2 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 21  3 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 21  4 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the

 21  7 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  8 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  9 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21 10 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21 11 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21 12 witnessing of executions.
 21 13    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21 14 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 15 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 16 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 17 after conviction but before execution.
 21 18    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 19 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 20 for refusing to participate.
 21 21    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
