  1 12 areas of superintendent management, business management, human
  1 13 resources, transportation, or operation and maintenance for at

  3 20 director or school counselor, or one or more operational
  3 21 functions in the areas of superintendent management, business
  3 22 management, human resources, transportation, or operation and
  3 23 maintenance for at least 20 percent of the school year is
  3 24 assigned a supplementary weighting for each shared operational

  3 26 available for a maximum of five school budget years beginning
  3 27 July 1, 2014, through the budget year beginning July 1, 2019.
