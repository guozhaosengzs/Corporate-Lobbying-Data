 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at

 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,

 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the

 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the

 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in

 14 11 witnesses shall be an individual designated by the facility.
 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as

 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,

 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the

 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the

 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of

 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the

 14 11 witnesses shall be an individual designated by the facility.
 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.

 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or

 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in

 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance

 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or

 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a

 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are

 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the

 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim

 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not

 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,

 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under

 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil

 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the

 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 12                           EXPLANATION
 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for
 16 22 medication to end a person's life.

 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides

 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for

 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
 16 16    The bill provides that if a governmental entity incurs costs
 16 17 resulting from a person terminating the person's life  under the
 16 18 bill in a public place, the governmental entity has a claim
 16 19 against the estate of the person to recover such costs and
 16 20 reasonable attorney fees related to enforcing the claim.
 16 21    The bill also provides the form for the request for

 14 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 15    This bill creates the "Iowa End=of=Life Options Act". The
 14 16 bill provides for a competent adult patient, who is a resident
 14 17 of the state of Iowa, who is terminally ill with less than six
 14 18 months to live as verified by two physicians, to voluntarily
 14 19 request medication that will end the person's life. The
 14 20 bill provides that the patient must make an oral request, a
 14 21 subsequent oral request no less than 15 days after the initial
 14 22 request, and a written request for the medication.  There is
 14 23 also a 48=hour  waiting period between the submission of the
 14 24 written request and the writing of the prescription.  The bill
 14 25 specifies the responsibilities of the attending physician and
 14 26 the consulting physician.  The bill includes a provision for
 14 27 counseling if the attending physician deems it appropriate, the
 14 28 notification of next of kin, the right to rescind a request at
 14 29 any time, and documentation requirements.  The bill provides
 14 30 for the effect of a request for medication to end the person's
 14 31 life on the construction of wills, contracts, and statutes as
 14 32 well as on insurance and annuity policies.
 14 33    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are not
 14 34 to be construed to authorize a physician or any other person
 14 35 to end a patient's life by lethal injection, mercy killing,
 15  1 or active euthanasia, and that actions taken in accordance
 15  2 with the bill shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide,
 15  3 assisted suicide, mercy killing, or homicide under the
 15  4 law.  Additionally, the provisions of the bill are not to be
 15  5 interpreted to lessen the applicable standard of care for the
 15  6 attending physician, consulting physician, psychiatrist, or
 15  7 psychologist, or other health care provider acting under the
 15  8 bill.
 15  9    The bill provides immunities for a person who acts in
 15 10 good=faith compliance with the bill, including being present
 15 11 when a patient takes the prescribed medication to end the
 15 12 patient's life.
 15 13    The bill provides that a professional organization or
 15 14 association, or health care provider, shall not subject a
 15 15 person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license,
 15 16 loss of privileges, loss of  membership, or other penalty for
 15 17 acting or refusing to act in good=faith  compliance with the
 15 18 bill, but does provide for prohibitions by a health care
 15 19 provider on the premises of the health care provider relative
 15 20 to the bill. The bill provides that a request by a patient
 15 21 for or provision by an attending physician of medication in
 15 22 good=faith compliance with the bill does not constitute neglect
 15 23 under the law or provide the sole basis for the appointment
 15 24 of a guardian or conservator for the patient.  Under the
 15 25 bill, a health care provider is not to be under any duty,
 15 26 whether by contract, statute, or any other legal requirement
 15 27 to participate in the provision to a patient of medication to
 15 28 end the patient's  life.   If a health care provider is unable
 15 29 or unwilling to carry out a patient's request under the bill,
 15 30 however, and the patient transfers the patient's care to a
 15 31 new health care provider, the prior health care provider is
 15 32 required to transfer, upon request, a copy of the patient's
 15 33 relevant medical records to the new health care provider.
 15 34    The bill provides that a person who without authorization of
 15 35 the patient willfully alters or forges a request for medication
 16  1 under the bill or conceals or destroys a recision of such a
 16  2 request with the intent or effect of causing the patient's
 16  3 death is guilty of a class "A" felony. Additionally, a   person
 16  4 who coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request
 16  5 medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life under
 16  6 the bill, or to destroy a recision of such a request, is guilty
 16  7 of a class "A" felony.  A  class "A" felony is punishable by
 16  8 confinement for life without possibility of parole.
 16  9    The bill provides that the provisions of the bill are
 16 10 not to be construed to limit a person's liability for civil
 16 11 damages resulting from other negligent conduct or intentional
 16 12 misconduct by the person and that the penalties specified in
 16 13 the bill shall not preclude criminal penalties  applicable under
 16 14 other law for conduct which is inconsistent with the provisions
 16 15 of the bill.
