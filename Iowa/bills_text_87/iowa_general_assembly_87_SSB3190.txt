Under
current
law,
the
amount
of
certain
pension
payments
11


received
by
a
claimant
is
deducted
from
the
claimant’s
12


unemployment
benefits.
However,
the
reduction
in
benefits
13


is
decreased
by
the
percentage
of
contributions
the
claimant
14


made
to
the
pension
plan.
The
division
instead
provides
that
15


a
reduction
in
unemployment
benefits
due
to
pension
payments
16


received
will
only
occur
if
the
claimant’s
base
period
employer
17


has
made
100
percent
of
the
contributions
to
the
pension
plan.
18


The
division
strikes
language
requiring
employers
to
19


designate
a
period
for
the
allocation
of
vacation
pay
that
is
20


paid
out
to
an
employee
in
connection
with
a
separation
or
21


layoff.
The
division
provides
that
vacation
pay
paid
out
to
22


an
employee
shall
only
be
considered
wages
for
purposes
of
23


unemployment
benefits
for
a
maximum
of
five
workdays.
24


The
division
strikes
language
providing
that
a
telephone
or
25


in-person
hearing
for
an
appeal
of
a
determination
regarding
26


eligibility
for
unemployment
benefits
shall
not
be
scheduled
27


before
seven
days
after
the
parties
receive
notice
of
the
28


hearing.
The
division
instead
provides
that
a
notice
for
such
29


a
hearing
shall
be
sent
to
all
parties
at
least
10
days
before
30


the
hearing
date.
31


The
division
permits
the
department
in
its
discretion
32


to
require
a
nonprofit
organization
employing
15
or
more
33


full-time
individuals
that
elects
to
become
liable
for
payments

Failure

The
division
strikes
language
permitting
the
department
18


in
its
discretion
to
allow
an

by
reason
of
19


the
nondisclosure
or
misrepresentation
of
a
material
fact,
20


receives
unemployment
benefits
without
meeting
the
conditions
21


of

or
while
disqualified
from
benefits
to
have
the
22


sum
of
the
benefits
received
deducted
from
future
benefits
23


payments.
Language
requiring
such
an
individual
to
repay
24


the

an
amount
equal
to
the

received
is
25


unchanged.

The
