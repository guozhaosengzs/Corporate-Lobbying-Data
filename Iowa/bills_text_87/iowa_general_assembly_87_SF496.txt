 15  9    DIVISION I ==== TAX EXPENDITURE STUDY.  Division I requires

 15 11 the fiscal impact that tax expenditures for certain taxes
 15 12 identified in the bill have on the revenue=raising capacity
 15 13 of the state.  "Tax expenditure" is defined in the bill,
 15 14 but generally includes any exclusion from the operation or
 15 15 collection of a tax such as a credit, exemption, deduction,
 15 16 rebate, or refund. The first study is required to be
 15 17 completed in 2018, and subsequent studies are required every
 15 18 even=numbered year thereafter.  The 2018 study is required to
 15 19 examine the relevant tax expenditures for the most recent year
 15 20 for which complete tax expenditure data is available.  Each
 15 21 subsequent study shall examine the relevant tax expenditure
 15 22 data for the year or years for which complete data is available
 15 23 since the last complete year studied.  However, if there is
 15 24 no new year with complete tax expenditure data available, LSA
 15 25 shall examine the available data for the year following the
 15 26 last complete year that was the subject of a previous report.
 15 27 Following each study, LSA is required to issue a report to the
 15 28 general assembly and the chairpersons of the legislative tax

 16  4 and rebates available against the income taxes, franchise
 16  5 taxes, moneys and credits tax, inheritance tax, sale and use
 16  6 taxes, and various other special excise taxes imposed by the
 16  7 state.
 16  8    In order for any particular tax expenditure to be applicable
 16  9 for a fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the bill
 16 10 requires the applicability of that tax expenditure during
 16 11 the fiscal year to be approved through an Act of the general
 16 12 assembly during the regular session preceding the beginning of
 16 13 the fiscal year.  Any such tax expenditure not approved for
 16 14 a fiscal year as provided in the bill shall not be available
 16 15 under Iowa law.
 16 16    The bill provides rules for the applicability of different
 16 17 types of tax expenditures.  A withholding tax credit approved
 16 18 for any particular fiscal year shall apply to amounts withheld
 16 19 by an employer from wages paid during that fiscal year.  Tax
 16 20 credits approved for any particular fiscal year shall be
 16 21 available for tax years beginning during that fiscal year.
 16 22 Sales and use tax refunds approved for any particular fiscal

 16 25 specified excise tax exemptions approved for any particular
 16 26 fiscal year shall be available for sales, purchases, transfers,
 16 27 or uses during that fiscal year.  Inheritance tax exemptions
 16 28 and deductions approved for any particular fiscal year shall

 16 31 calculation of the income taxes, the franchise tax, and the
 16 32 moneys and credits tax that are approved for any particular
 16 33 fiscal year shall be available for tax years beginning during
 16 34 that particular fiscal year.
 16 35    The bill provides that additional legislation may be
 17  1 required to fully implement the review and approval of tax
 17  2 expenditures required under the bill and requires the director
 17  3 of the department of revenue to prepare draft legislation
 17  4 in compliance with Code section 2.16 for submission to the
 17  5 legislative services agency, if necessary, to implement the
 17  6 bill.

 17 22 of tax credits which local governments are only required to

 17 24 appropriation.
 17 25    Finally, the bill strikes, for fiscal years beginning on or

 15  9    DIVISION I ==== TAX EXPENDITURE STUDY.  Division I requires
 15 10 the legislative services agency (LSA) to conduct a study on
 15 11 the fiscal impact that tax expenditures for certain taxes
 15 12 identified in the bill have on the revenue=raising capacity
 15 13 of the state.  "Tax expenditure" is defined in the bill,
 15 14 but generally includes any exclusion from the operation or
 15 15 collection of a tax such as a credit, exemption, deduction,
 15 16 rebate, or refund. The first study is required to be
 15 17 completed in 2018, and subsequent studies are required every
 15 18 even=numbered year thereafter.  The 2018 study is required to
 15 19 examine the relevant tax expenditures for the most recent year
 15 20 for which complete tax expenditure data is available.  Each
 15 21 subsequent study shall examine the relevant tax expenditure
 15 22 data for the year or years for which complete data is available
 15 23 since the last complete year studied.  However, if there is
 15 24 no new year with complete tax expenditure data available, LSA
 15 25 shall examine the available data for the year following the
 15 26 last complete year that was the subject of a previous report.
 15 27 Following each study, LSA is required to issue a report to the
 15 28 general assembly and the chairpersons of the legislative tax
 15 29 expenditure committee by January 31 of the following year,
 15 30 with the first report being required by January 31, 2019.  The

 16  4 and rebates available against the income taxes, franchise
 16  5 taxes, moneys and credits tax, inheritance tax, sale and use
 16  6 taxes, and various other special excise taxes imposed by the
 16  7 state.
 16  8    In order for any particular tax expenditure to be applicable
 16  9 for a fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the bill
 16 10 requires the applicability of that tax expenditure during
 16 11 the fiscal year to be approved through an Act of the general
 16 12 assembly during the regular session preceding the beginning of
 16 13 the fiscal year.  Any such tax expenditure not approved for
 16 14 a fiscal year as provided in the bill shall not be available
 16 15 under Iowa law.
 16 16    The bill provides rules for the applicability of different
 16 17 types of tax expenditures.  A withholding tax credit approved
 16 18 for any particular fiscal year shall apply to amounts withheld
 16 19 by an employer from wages paid during that fiscal year.  Tax
 16 20 credits approved for any particular fiscal year shall be
 16 21 available for tax years beginning during that fiscal year.
 16 22 Sales and use tax refunds approved for any particular fiscal
 16 23 year shall be available for sales and use tax liability

 16 25 specified excise tax exemptions approved for any particular
 16 26 fiscal year shall be available for sales, purchases, transfers,
 16 27 or uses during that fiscal year.  Inheritance tax exemptions
 16 28 and deductions approved for any particular fiscal year shall

 16 31 calculation of the income taxes, the franchise tax, and the
 16 32 moneys and credits tax that are approved for any particular
 16 33 fiscal year shall be available for tax years beginning during
 16 34 that particular fiscal year.
 16 35    The bill provides that additional legislation may be
 17  1 required to fully implement the review and approval of tax
 17  2 expenditures required under the bill and requires the director
 17  3 of the department of revenue to prepare draft legislation
 17  4 in compliance with Code section 2.16 for submission to the
