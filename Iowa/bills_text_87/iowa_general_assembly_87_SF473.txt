  3 10                           EXPLANATION
  3 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 13    Under current law, commercial learner's permits are valid
  3 14 for 180 days and may be renewed for an additional 180 days
  3 15 without retaking the required general and endorsement knowledge
  3 16 tests. This bill alters that provision to incorporate by
  3 17 reference the validity and renewal periods provided by the
  3 18 code of federal regulations as well as an exemption for state
  3 19 driver's licensing agencies. Although the code of federal
  3 20 regulations specifies the same 180=day validity and renewal
  3 21 periods, state driver's licensing agencies are currently
  3 22 exempted from those periods by the federal motor carrier safety
  3 23 administration, and may instead allow commercial learner's
  3 24 permits to be valid for one year with no renewal period.
  3 25    The bill provides that a motor vehicle equipped with an
  3 26 engine fueled primarily by compressed natural gas may exceed
  3 27 any applicable maximum gross weight limit under Code chapter
  3 28 321, up to a maximum gross weight of 82,000 pounds, by an
  3 29 amount equal to the difference between the weight of the
  3 30 vehicle attributable to the compressed natural gas tank and
  3 31 fueling system installed in the vehicle and the weight of a
  3 32 comparable diesel fuel tank and fueling system.
  3 33    The bill further provides that such a motor vehicle equipped
  3 34 with an auxiliary power or idle reduction technology unit that
  3 35 reduces fuel use and emissions during engine idling may exceed
  4  1 any applicable maximum gross weight limit by 550 pounds or the
  4  2 weight of the auxiliary power or idle reduction technology
  4  3 unit, whichever is less.  However, this provision does not
  4  4 apply unless the operator of the vehicle provides to the
  4  5 department of transportation (DOT) a written certification of
  4  6 the weight of the auxiliary power or idle reduction technology
  4  7 unit, demonstrates or certifies to the DOT that the idle
  4  8 reduction technology unit is fully functional at all times,
  4  9 and carries with the operator the written certification of the
  4 10 weight of the auxiliary power or idle reduction technology unit
  4 11 in the vehicle at all times to present to law enforcement in
  4 12 the event the vehicle is suspected of violating any applicable
  4 13 weight restrictions.
  4 14    Current law provides that certain employees of the DOT may be
  4 15 designated as peace officers authorized to control and direct
  4 16 traffic and weigh vehicles, and to make arrests for violations
  4 17 of the motor vehicle laws relating to the operating authority,
  4 18 registration, size, weight, and load of motor vehicles and
  4 19 trailers, and registration of a motor carrier's interstate
  4 20 transportation service with the DOT.
  4 21    The bill authorizes peace officers employed by the DOT
  4 22 to enforce all laws of the state including but not limited
  4 23 to the rules and regulations of the DOT.  The bill requires
  4 24 DOT employees designated as peace officers to primarily
  4 25 engage in the enforcement of federal motor carrier safety
  4 26 regulations and federal motor carrier hazardous materials
  4 27 regulations; the regulation of the operating authority of
  4 28 motor carriers; the regulation of the movement, safety, and
  4 29 lawful operation of commercial motor vehicles; the regulation
  4 30 of the operating authority of commercial motor vehicle
  4 31 operators; the enforcement of traffic and safety laws on
  4 32 operators of commercial motor vehicles; the enforcement and
  4 33 performance of other activities necessary for the motor carrier
  4 34 safety assistance program and the high priority program;
  4 35 the investigation and enforcement of matters relating to or
  5  1 arising out of responsibilities entrusted to the DOT; the
  5  2 control and direction of traffic; and the enforcement of motor
  5  3 vehicle laws relating to the operating authority, registration,
  5  4 size, weight, and load of motor vehicles and trailers. This
  5  5 provision of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  3 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 13    Under current law, commercial learner's permits are valid
  3 14 for 180 days and may be renewed for an additional 180 days
  3 15 without retaking the required general and endorsement knowledge
  3 16 tests. This bill alters that provision to incorporate by
  3 17 reference the validity and renewal periods provided by the
  3 18 code of federal regulations as well as an exemption for state
  3 19 driver's licensing agencies. Although the code of federal

  3 21 periods, state driver's licensing agencies are currently
  3 22 exempted from those periods by the federal motor carrier safety
  3 23 administration, and may instead allow commercial learner's
  3 24 permits to be valid for one year with no renewal period.
  3 25    The bill provides that a motor vehicle equipped with an
  3 26 engine fueled primarily by compressed natural gas may exceed
  3 27 any applicable maximum gross weight limit under Code chapter
  3 28 321, up to a maximum gross weight of 82,000 pounds, by an
  3 29 amount equal to the difference between the weight of the
  3 30 vehicle attributable to the compressed natural gas tank and
  3 31 fueling system installed in the vehicle and the weight of a
  3 32 comparable diesel fuel tank and fueling system.
  3 33    The bill further provides that such a motor vehicle equipped
  3 34 with an auxiliary power or idle reduction technology unit that
  3 35 reduces fuel use and emissions during engine idling may exceed
  4  1 any applicable maximum gross weight limit by 550 pounds or the
