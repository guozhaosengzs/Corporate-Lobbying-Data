  1 20                           EXPLANATION
  1 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 23    Current law exempts from the Iowa sales and use tax the
  1 24 sale, rental, or use of aircraft component parts permanently
  1 25 attached to an aircraft, including repair or replacement
  1 26 materials or parts, and repair, remodeling, and maintenance
  1 27 services used on an aircraft, aircraft engine, or aircraft
  1 28 component materials or parts,  provided the aircraft is used
  1 29 in either a scheduled or nonscheduled interstate federal
  1 30 aviation administration (FAA) certified air carrier operation
  1 31 (scheduled or nonscheduled FAA operation).  This bill removes
  1 32 the requirement that the aircraft be used in a scheduled or
  1 33 nonscheduled FAA operation to qualify for the exemption.  The
  1 34 sale, rental, or use of the component parts and services
  1 35 described above will be exempt from the sales and use tax
  2  1 when permanently attached to or performed on any aircraft.
  2  2 The bill defines "aircraft" to mean the same as it does for
  2  3 purposes of Code chapter 328 (aeronautics), which includes any
  2  4 contrivance now known, or hereafter invented, used or designed
  2  5 for navigation of or flight in the air, for the purpose of
  2  6 transporting persons or property, or both.
  2  7    The bill also makes nonsubstantive changes to Code sections
  2  8 423.3(74) and 423.3(75) to strike or move similar language
  2  9 relating to the sales and use tax exemption described in the
  2 10 bill and to the sales and use tax exemption for the sale or
  2 11 rental of aircraft used in a scheduled FAA operation.
