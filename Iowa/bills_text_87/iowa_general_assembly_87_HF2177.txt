  3 31 and employers and provide employers and consumers with access
  3 32 to information in the recruitment, selection, and employment
  3 33 of direct care workers; and to provide the data necessary
  3 34 to  ensure a well=prepared direct care workforce to meet the
  3 35 growing demand for their services.
  4  1 The bill specifies the membership of the stakeholder
  4  2 workgroup and the duties of the workgroup, including
  4  3 development of a centralized direct care workforce database to
  4  4 provide a comprehensive direct care workforce data collection
  4  5 and tracking system;  reviewing prior efforts to expand
  4  6 the nurse aide registry to determine if these technologies
  4  7 could be brought to scale or implemented to save costs and
  4  8 resources in implementing the database; soliciting input from
  4  9 stakeholders on the types of data to  be collected and the types
  4 10 of analyses to be performed in building and retaining the
  4 11 high=demand direct care workforce; recommending strategies to
  4 12 provide a state=recognized, competency=based, comprehensive,
  4 13 cross=discipline training for direct care workers;  developing a
  4 14 public awareness plan to inform workers, employers, consumers,
  4 15 advocates, educators, and others about the database; exploring
  4 16 state, federal, and other sources of funding and reviewing the
  4 17 status of prior private foundation investments in modifications
  4 18 of the Iowa nurse aide registry to support the database;
  4 19 and developing a phased=in plan for implementation of the
  4 20 centralized direct care workforce database to begin no later
  4 21 than July 1, 2019.
  4 22    The bill requires the stakeholder workgroup to convene no
  4 23 later than September 1, 2018, and submit a report, including a
  4 24 phased=in implementation plan for the centralized direct care
