APPLICABILITY.
This
Act
applies
to
estates
of
7


decedents
that
include
a
deferred
estate
or
remainder
interest
8


and
that
have
not,
on
or
before

received
approval
9


from
the
department
of
revenue
to
defer
payment
of
tax
pursuant
10


to
sections
450.44
through
450.49.

EXPLANATION
12


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
13


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
14


This
bill
relates
to
the
inheritance
tax.
An
estate
15


subject
to
the
inheritance
tax
may
contain
a
deferred
estate
16


or
remainder
interest,
which
generally
occurs
when
property
is
17


transferred
to
a
person
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
and
then
18


to
a
different
person
(remainderman)
at
the
expiration
of
that
19


time.
Under
Iowa
law,
the
inheritance
tax
accrues
at
the
date
20


of
death
of
the
decedent
and
is
due
on
or
before
the
last
day
of
21


the
ninth
month
following
that
date.
However,
the
payment
of
22


inheritance
tax
may
be
deferred
for
a
remainderman
until
such
23


time
as
the
property
actually
passes
to
that
person.
24


When
inheritance
tax
deferral
is
elected,
Iowa
law
requires
25


that
a
bond
be
given
to
secure
the
payment
of
the
tax
unless
the
26


estate
contains
real
property
and
the
automatic
lien
on
such
27


real
property
is
sufficient
to
secure
payment
of
the
deferred
28


tax.


29


The
bill
provides
that,
in
lieu
of
a
bond,
an
estate
30


containing
personal
property,
real
property,
or
a
mix
of
31


both,
may
provide
other
security
to
secure
payment
of
the
32


deferred
tax.
The
bill
provides
that
the
other
security
must
33


be
satisfactory
to
the
department
of
revenue
(DOR).
The
bill
34


includes
as
examples
of
other
security
a
bank
or
securities

and

escrow
funds
in

The
bill

of
the
type
and
amount
6


of
the
other
security
be
added
to
the
record
of
the
deferred
7


estate
required
to
be
kept
under

section
450.20.
