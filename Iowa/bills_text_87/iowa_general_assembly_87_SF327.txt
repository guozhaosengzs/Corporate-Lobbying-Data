  4 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 18    This bill relates to the membership of the state judicial
  4 19 nominating commission and the district judicial nominating
  4 20 commissions.
  4 21    The state judicial nominating commission nominates persons
  4 22 for appointment by the governor to the supreme court and the
  4 23 court of appeals.  The judicial district nominating commissions
  4 24 nominate persons for appointment by the governor to the
  4 25 district court bench as district judges.
  4 26    STATE JUDICIAL NOMINATING COMMISSION.  The bill specifies
  4 27 that members appointed to the state judicial nominating
  4 28 commission by the governor shall be voting members of the
  4 29 commission and members elected to the commission by members
  4 30 of the state bar shall be advisory nonvoting members of the
  4 31 commission.  Current law provides that both appointed and
  4 32 elected members of the state judicial nominating commission are
  4 33 voting members.
  4 34    The bill establishes a process for transitioning the voting
  4 35 membership of the state judicial nominating commission from
  5  1 eight members appointed by the governor and eight members
  5  2 elected by the state bar to 16 members only appointed by the
  5  3 governor.
  5  4    In order for the state judicial nominating commission to
  5  5 transition from eight appointed members to 16 appointed members
  5  6 and to ensure each appointed member serves a six=year term,
  5  7 and future terms are staggered, the size of the state judicial
  5  8 nominating commission shall vary during the transitional period
  5  9 under the bill.  Beginning with the two appointive terms
  5 10 ending on April 30, 2018, the governor shall appoint five
  5 11 eligible electors to the state judicial nominating commission.
  5 12 The appointive membership of the state judicial nominating
  5 13 commission shall then consist of 11 appointed members from May
  5 14 1, 2018, through April 30, 2020. Beginning with the three
  5 15 appointive terms ending on April 30, 2020, the governor shall
  5 16 appoint six eligible electors to the state judicial nominating
  5 17 commission.  The appointive membership of the state judicial
  5 18 nominating commission shall then consist of 14 appointed
  5 19 members from May 1, 2020, through April 30, 2022.  Beginning
  5 20 with the two appointive terms ending on April 30, 2022, the
  5 21 governor shall appoint four eligible electors to the state
  5 22 judicial nominating commission.  The appointive membership
  5 23 of the state judicial nominating commission, having achieved
  5 24 the required number of appointed members, shall consist of 16
  5 25 appointed members after May 1, 2022, and every year thereafter.
  5 26    The bill reduces the number of members of the state judicial
  5 27 nominating commission elected by the resident members of
  5 28 the bar from seven members to one member by July 1, 2021,
  5 29 and makes all current elected members nonvoting members of
  5 30 the commission.  The current members of the state judicial
  5 31 nominating commission shall remain on the commission until the
  5 32 respective term of the member ends.  The last terms of current
  5 33 elected members end on June 30, 2021.  When the last terms
  5 34 of current elected members end, the bill provides that the
  5 35 resident members of the bar shall elect one eligible elector
  6  1 of the state to the state judicial nominating commission for a
  6  2 six=year, nonvoting term beginning July 1, 2021, and every six
  6  3 years thereafter.
  6  4    DISTRICT JUDICIAL NOMINATING COMMISSIONS.  The bill
  6  5 specifies that members appointed to the district judicial
  6  6 nominating commissions by the governor shall be voting members
  6  7 of the commissions and members elected to the commission by
  6  8 members of the state bar shall be advisory, nonvoting members
  6  9 of the commissions.  Current law provides that both appointed
  6 10 and elected members of the district judicial nominating
  6 11 commissions are voting members.
  6 12    Under the bill, the number of commissioners appointed by the
  6 13 governor to serve on a district judicial nominating commission
  6 14 remains at five commissioners.
  6 15    The bill reduces the number of commissioners of a district
  6 16 judicial nominating commission elected by the resident members
  6 17 of the bar from five members to one member by February 1, 2022,
  6 18 and makes all current elected members nonvoting members of
  6 19 the commission.  The current members of the district judicial
  6 20 nominating commission shall remain on the commission until
  6 21 their respective terms end.  The last term of a current
  6 22 elected member ends on January 31, 2022.  When the last term
  6 23 of a current elected member ends, the bill provides that the
  6 24 resident members of the bar shall elect one eligible elector of
  6 25 the state to the district judicial nominating commission for a
  6 26 six=year, nonvoting term beginning February 1, 2022, and every
  6 27 six years thereafter.
  6 28    CHAIRPERSON OF STATE JUDICIAL NOMINATING COMMISSION OR
  6 29 DISTRICT JUDICIAL NOMINATING COMMISSION.  The bill repeals Code
  6 30 section 46.6 relating to judicial officers with equal seniority
  6 31 serving as chairperson of the state judicial nominating
  6 32 commission or a district judicial nominating commission and
  6 33 moves these provisions to new Code sections 46.2A and 46.4A
  6 34 respectively.
  6 35    The bill makes the justice of the supreme court, who is the
  7  1 chairperson of the state judicial nominating commission, a
  7  2 nonvoting, advisory member of the commission unless a vote ends
  7  3 in a tie, in such case the bill provides that the chairperson
  7  4 is eligible to cast the tie=breaking vote.
  7  5    The bill also makes the district judge, who is chairperson
  7  6 of the district judicial nominating commission, a nonvoting,
  7  7 advisory member of the commission unless a vote ends in a
  7  8 tie, in such case, the bill provides that the chairperson is
