  3 18    This bill provides that "manufacturer" under Code sections
  3 19 321.1 and 322.2 includes a final=stage manufacturer. The
  3 20 bill defines "final=stage manufacturer" to mean a person who
  3 21 performs such manufacturing operations on an incomplete motor
  3 22 vehicle that it becomes a completed motor vehicle. "Incomplete
  3 23 motor vehicle" means an assemblage consisting, at a minimum,
  3 24 of frame and chassis structure, power train, steering system,
  3 25 suspension system, and braking system to the extent that those
  3 26 systems are to be part of a completed motor vehicle, that
  3 27 requires further manufacturing operations, other than the
  3 28 addition of readily attachable components, such as mirrors or
  3 29 tire and rim assemblies, or minor finishing operations such as
  3 30 painting, to become a completed motor vehicle.
  3 31    Under current law, Code section 322.3(1) prohibits a person
  3 32 from engaging in the business of selling at retail new motor
  3 33 vehicles of any make, or from representing or advertising that
  3 34 the person is engaged or intends to engage in such business,
  3 35 unless the person is authorized to do so by a contract in
  4  1 writing with the manufacturer or distributor of such make of
  4  2 new motor vehicles and unless the department of transportation
  4  3 has licensed the person as a motor vehicle dealer in motor
  4  4 vehicles of such make and has issued to the person a license
  4  5 in writing as provided in Code chapter 322. The bill provides
  4  6 that this prohibition shall not be construed to prohibit a
  4  7 final=stage manufacturer of multi=stage manufactured vehicles
  4  8 that holds a used motor vehicle dealer license from assigning
  4  9 a multi=stage manufactured vehicle's manufacturer's statement
  4 10 of origin to a retail buyer for purposes of issuance of a
  4 11 certificate of title by a county treasurer as a new motor
  4 12 vehicle with the same make as the multi=stage manufactured
  4 13 vehicle without holding a new motor vehicle dealer license
  4 14 and without paying any associated motor vehicle registration

  4 21 vehicle manufacturer or importer from directly or indirectly
  4 22 being licensed as, owning an interest in, operating, or

  4 26 to be licensed as a used motor vehicle dealer and to assign a
  4 27 multi=stage manufactured vehicle's manufacturer's statement
