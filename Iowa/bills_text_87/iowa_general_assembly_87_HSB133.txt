striking
the

penalty
for

dangerous
weapons.
Instead,
the
bill
11


creates
a
new
crime
of
going
armed
with
a
knife
in
the
12


commission
of
a
crime,
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
The
bill
13


makes
a
conforming
change
to
Code
section
232.52,
subsection
14


2,
relating
to
the
suspension
or
revocation
of
a
juvenile’s

16


The
bill
amends

grounds

The
amendment
to
Code
section
724.4B
19


preserves
current
law
by
keeping
the
general
prohibition
on
20


carrying
weapons
on
school
grounds
but
inserts
the
exceptions
21


to
carrying
weapons
on
school
grounds
previously
contained
in
22


Code
section
724.4.
23


The
bill
amends
Code
section
724.4C
relating
to
the
crime
of
24


possession
or
carrying
of
firearms
while
under
the
influence
25


of
alcohol
or
a
drug.
Current
law
invalidates
a
permit
to
26


carry
weapons
if
the
person
to
whom
the
permit
is
issued
is
27


intoxicated,
as
defined
in
Code
section
321J.2,
subsection
1


28


(while
under
the
influence
of
an
alcoholic
beverage
or
other
29


drug
or
a
combination
of
such
substances,
while
having
an
30


alcohol
concentration
of
.08

more,

of
a
31


controlled
substance
is
present
in
the
person,
as
measured
in
32


the
person’s

or

The
bill
amends
this
provision
33


to
provide
that
a
person
commits
a
serious
misdemeanor
if
34


the
person
is
intoxicated
and

providing
that
the
availability
13


of
a
professional

nonprofessional
permit
to
carry
weapons
14


shall
not
be
construed
to
impose
a
general
prohibition
on
the
15


unlicensed
carrying
of
a
dangerous
weapon
including
a
loaded
16


firearm.
However,
the

from
unlicensed
carrying,
whether
openly

concealed,
of
a

The

strikes
the
requirements
that

of
that
permit.
Thus,
the
change
in
the
bill
allows
a
person
8


operating
or
riding
on
a
snowmobile
or

vehicle
to
