  3  2                           EXPLANATION
  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    This bill relates to providing and expunging a DNA sample in
  3  6 criminal proceedings involving a person arrested for a felony.
  3  7    Current law requires a person convicted of a felony or
  3  8 certain aggravated misdemeanors to submit a DNA sample for DNA
  3  9 profiling. The bill requires a person arrested for a felony
  3 10 to submit a DNA sample for DNA profiling, upon a finding by a
  3 11 magistrate that probable cause exists for the arrest.
  3 12    The bill requires the supervising agency with jurisdiction
  3 13 over a person arrested for a felony to collect the DNA sample
  3 14 after a finding of probable cause.
  3 15    The bill allows a person arrested for a felony to expunge
  3 16 the DNA record from the DNA database and DNA data bank if the
  3 17 person's felony arrest does not lead to the conviction of any
  3 18 offense.
