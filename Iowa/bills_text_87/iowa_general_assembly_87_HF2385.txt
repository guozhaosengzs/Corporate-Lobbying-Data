  6  6 college tuition grant program, changing the requirements for
  6  7 qualification, requiring the student to enter into an agreement
  6  8 with the commission, and providing that the grant pays the
  6  9 lesser of the student's tuition and mandatory fees for not more
  6 10 than the equivalent of two full years of study at a community
  6 11 college, or the amount of the student's financial need for that
