  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    This bill relates to the temporary delegation of parental
  2 28 authority by the parent or legal custodian of a child.
  2 29    The bill provides that a parent or legal custodian of a
  2 30 child, by a properly executed power of attorney, may delegate
  2 31 to another person any powers regarding the care or custody of
  2 32 the child except the power to consent to the child's marriage,
  2 33 the power to consent to the child's adoption, the power to
  2 34 consent to the performance or inducement of an abortion on or
  2 35 for the child, and the power to consent to the termination of
  3  1 the parental rights of a parent of the child. A parent or legal
  3  2 custodian shall have the authority to revoke or terminate a
  3  3 power of attorney created under the bill at any time.
  3  4    Except for certain military personnel, a power of attorney
  3  5 created under the bill shall be for a period of time not to
  3  6 exceed one year. The parent or legal custodian of the child is
  3  7 required to execute a new power of attorney for each additional
  3  8 year that the delegation of power exists. If the parent or
  3  9 legal custodian revokes or terminates the power of attorney,
  3 10 the child shall be returned to the care and custody of the
  3 11 parent or legal custodian as soon as reasonably possible.
  3 12    An agent (person granted authority to act for a parent
  3 13 or legal custodian under a power of attorney created in the
  3 14 bill) is required to exercise parental or legal authority on a
  3 15 continuous basis without compensation for the duration of the
  3 16 power of attorney and shall not be considered to be a foster
  3 17 parent subject to licensure by the department of human services
  3 18 pursuant to Code chapter 237 (child foster care facilities).  A
  3 19 power of attorney executed under the bill by a parent or legal
  3 20 custodian shall not constitute abandonment, abuse, or neglect
  3 21 of the child by the parent or legal custodian unless the parent
  3 22 or legal custodian fails to take custody of the child or to
  3 23 execute a subsequent power of attorney upon the expiration of
  3 24 the original power of attorney.
  3 25    The bill provides power of attorney execution requirements
  3 26 and requires the department of human services, in consultation
  3 27 with the judicial branch, to develop forms for carrying out the
  3 28 provisions of the bill.

  3 21 of the child by the parent or legal custodian unless the parent
  3 22 or legal custodian fails to take custody of the child or to
  3 23 execute a subsequent power of attorney upon the expiration of
  3 24 the original power of attorney.
  3 25    The bill provides power of attorney execution requirements
