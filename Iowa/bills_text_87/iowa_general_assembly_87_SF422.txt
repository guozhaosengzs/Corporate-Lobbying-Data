 10  7                           EXPLANATION
 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    This bill relates to domestic abuse and other offenses
 10 11 involving a domestic relationship, and provides penalties.
 10 12    MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  Under the bill, if a person is
 10 13 convicted of a violation of a no=contact order or a protective
 10 14 order pursuant to Code chapter 664A, or alternatively the
 10 15 person is held in contempt of court for such a violation, and
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10  7                           EXPLANATION
 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    This bill relates to domestic abuse and other offenses
 10 11 involving a domestic relationship, and provides penalties.
 10 12    MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  Under the bill, if a person is
 10 13 convicted of a violation of a no=contact order or a protective
 10 14 order pursuant to Code chapter 664A, or alternatively the
 10 15 person is held in contempt of court for such a violation, and
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in

 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    This bill relates to domestic abuse and other offenses
 10 11 involving a domestic relationship, and provides penalties.
 10 12    MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  Under the bill, if a person is
 10 13 convicted of a violation of a no=contact order or a protective
 10 14 order pursuant to Code chapter 664A, or alternatively the
 10 15 person is held in contempt of court for such a violation, and
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If

 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a

 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    This bill relates to domestic abuse and other offenses
 10 11 involving a domestic relationship, and provides penalties.
 10 12    MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  Under the bill, if a person is
 10 13 convicted of a violation of a no=contact order or a protective
 10 14 order pursuant to Code chapter 664A, or alternatively the
 10 15 person is held in contempt of court for such a violation, and
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,

 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to

 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,

 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions

 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a

 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are

 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the

 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10 11 involving a domestic relationship, and provides penalties.
 10 12    MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  Under the bill, if a person is
 10 13 convicted of a violation of a no=contact order or a protective
 10 14 order pursuant to Code chapter 664A, or alternatively the
 10 15 person is held in contempt of court for such a violation, and
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.
       LSB 1398SV (1) 87
       jm/nh
 10 12    MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  Under the bill, if a person is
 10 13 convicted of a violation of a no=contact order or a protective
 10 14 order pursuant to Code chapter 664A, or alternatively the
 10 15 person is held in contempt of court for such a violation, and
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of

 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.
       LSB 1398SV (1) 87
       jm/nh
 10 14 order pursuant to Code chapter 664A, or alternatively the
 10 15 person is held in contempt of court for such a violation, and
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for

 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.
       LSB 1398SV (1) 87
       jm/nh
 10 16 ordered to be supervised by the judicial district department
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.
       LSB 1398SV (1) 87
       jm/nh
 10 17 of correctional services or to participate in a batterers'
 10 18 treatment program, the court shall order the person to submit
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.
       LSB 1398SV (1) 87
       jm/nh
 10 19 to a risk assessment pursuant to new Code section 901.5C.  If
 10 20 a person is convicted of domestic abuse assault under Code
 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,

 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic

 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred

 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations

 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a

 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2

 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or

 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board

 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 10 21 section 708.2A, the bill requires the person to submit to a
 10 22 risk assessment.
 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of

 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or

 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one

 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths

 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the

 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and

 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 10 23    REQUIREMENTS OF MANDATORY RISK ASSESSMENT.  The bill
 10 24 requires the risk assessment be performed by the judicial
 10 25 district department of correctional services or a contract
 10 26 service provider of a batterers' treatment program for domestic
 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of

 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If

 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2

 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for

 10 27 abuse offenders, using a validated risk assessment developed
 10 28 by the board of parole and approved by the department of
 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.

 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under

 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2

 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the

 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the

 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory

 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or

 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.

 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2

 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board

 10 29 corrections.  The bill also requires the court to consider
 10 30 the risk assessment in determining the appropriate conditions
 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and

 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board

 10 31 for release. In determining whether to release a defendant,
 10 32 the court shall determine whether sufficient conditions for
 10 33 release are available that are designed to reduce the risk to
 10 34 another individual, detect threatening or criminal behavior,
 10 35 and increase the safety of individuals and the general public,
 11  1 and balance those determinations with the potential risk of
 11  2 harm if the defendant is released.
 11  3    ELECTRONIC TRACKING AND MONITORING.  The bill provides
 11  4 that the court may order the defendant to participate in a
 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court

 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of

 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific

 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class

 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category

 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and

 11  5 program that includes the use of an electronic tracking and
 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet

 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the

 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic

 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and

 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global

 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and

 11  6 monitoring system as a condition of release in a mandatory
 11  7 risk assessment situation for violating a no=contact order or
 11  8 protective order, being convicted of domestic abuse assault,
 11  9 or as a condition of release for a bailable defendant if the
 11 10 defendant is a risk to another person.  The bill specifies that
 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of

 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory

 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of

 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a

 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation

 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of

 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board

 11 11 when ordering the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 12 system the court shall consider the safety of the victim and
 11 13 other legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 11 14 If an electronic tracking and monitoring system is ordered,
 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,

 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court

 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first

 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court

 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course

 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class

 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2

 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for

 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the

 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first

 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court

 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory

 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred

 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class

 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following

 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category

 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board

 11 15 the court is required to order the defendant to pay the costs
 11 16 associated with the imposition of the system.  If the defendant
 11 17 fails to pay the fees of the electronic tracking and monitoring
 11 18 system in a timely manner, the bill provides that the court may
 11 19 impose garnishment of the defendant's wages in order to meet
 11 20 the payment obligation.
 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of
 11 27 Code section 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in
 11 28 violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense involved a
 11 29 domestic relationship; stalking in violation of Code section
 11 30 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic relationship;
 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the

 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a

 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory

 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who

 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following

 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the

 11 21    The bill also specifies that a person placed on probation,
 11 22 parole, work release, special sentence, or any other type of
 11 23 conditional release may be supervised by an electronic tracking
 11 24 and monitoring system in addition to any other conditions
 11 25 of supervision if the person was convicted of any of the
 11 26 following offenses: domestic abuse assault in violation of

 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2

 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for

 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a

 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of

 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also

 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board
 15  5 of parole to develop a validated risk assessment model for
 15  6 domestic abuse assault in consultation with the department of
 15  7 corrections.

 11 31 and stalking in violation of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and
 11 32 the offense involved a domestic relationship.
 11 33    The bill further specifies that when considering whether to
 11 34 order the use of an electronic tracking and monitoring system
 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the

 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or

 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or

 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section

 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.
 15  4    BOARD OF PAROLE ==== RULES.  The bill requires the board

 11 35 the court shall consider the safety of the victim and other
 12  1 legitimate factors that may impact all of the parties.
 12  2    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC ABUSE ASSAULT.  If
 12  3 a person is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse
 12  4 assault as referred to in Code section 708.2A(4), the bill
 12  5 requires the person to serve between one=fifth of the maximum
 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.
 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first
 12 19 degree in violation of Code section 708.7(2), and the offense
 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a
 12 26 deferred judgment or sentence. If a person is convicted of
 12 27 a third or subsequent stalking offense in violation of Code
 12 28 section 708.11(3)(a), and the offense involved a domestic
 12 29 relationship, the bill requires the person to serve a mandatory
 12 30 five=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who commits such
 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred
 13  4 judgment or sentence.
 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 12 31 a stalking offense commits a class "C" felony.  The bill also
 12 32 prohibits the person from receiving a deferred judgment or
 12 33 sentence.  If a person is convicted of stalking in violation
 12 34 of Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), and the offense involved a
 12 35 domestic relationship, the bill requires the person to serve
 13  1 a mandatory three=year minimum prison sentence.  A person who
 13  2 commits such a stalking offense commits a class "D" felony.
 13  3 The bill also prohibits the person from receiving a deferred

 13  5    STALKING.  The bill expands the definition of "course
 13  6 of conduct" for purposes of the definition of the crime of
 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000).
 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under
 13 33 the bill, a person commits unauthorized placement of a global
 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 14  8    ACCUMULATION OF EARNED TIME.  The bill changes the following
 14  9 offenses from a category "A" sentence under Code section 903A.2
 14 10 to a category "B" sentence under Code section 903A.2: a third
 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 14 22 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement to a
 14 23 maximum accumulation of earned time of fifteen eighty=fifths
 14 24 of a day for each day of good conduct.  However, the category
 14 25 "B" offenses in the bill are not limited to serving at least
 14 26 seven=tenths of the maximum term of the person's sentence as
 14 27 provided in Code section 902.12 but are required to serve the
 14 28 mandatory minimum sentence in new Code section 902.13 in the
 14 29 bill.
 14 30    The bill also specifies that an inmate sentenced under new
 14 31 Code section 902.13 is required to participate in a domestic
 14 32 abuse treatment program, if required, and is not eligible for
 14 33 a reduction of sentence unless the defendant participates and
 14 34 completes such a program.  If a defendant participates and
 14 35 completes the domestic abuse treatment program, the defendant
 15  1 is entitled to a reduction of fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
 15  2 for each day the defendant demonstrates good conduct and
 15  3 participates in a program or placement.

 12  6 term and the maximum term of the person's sentence.  The bill
 12  7 provides that the sentencing court shall determine the term of
 12  8 confinement within the above=mentioned parameters.  A person
 12  9 who commits a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault
 12 10 commits a class "D" felony.  The bill and current law also
 12 11 prohibit a person convicted of such a domestic abuse assault
 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a
 12 13 suspended sentence.
 12 14    MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE ==== DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP.

 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first

 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court
 12 22 sentences the person to a term of confinement that exceeds one
 12 23 year.  A person who commits harassment in the first degree
 12 24 commits an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill also prohibits a
 12 25 person convicted of the harassment offense from receiving a

 12 12 offense from receiving a deferred judgment or sentence, or a

 12 15  The bill defines "domestic relationship" similarly to the
 12 16 relationships required to commit "domestic abuse" in Code
 12 17 section 236.2 except that certain "intimate relationships" are
 12 18 excluded.  If a person is convicted of harassment in the first

 12 20 involved a domestic relationship, the bill requires the person
 12 21 to serve a one=year mandatory minimum sentence, if the court

 13  7 stalking contained in Code section 708.11 to include situations
 13  8 where a technological device is repeatedly used to locate,
 13  9 listen to, or watch a person without a legitimate purpose.
 13 10    The bill modifies the elements of the criminal offense
 13 11 of stalking to provide that a person commits the crime of
 13 12 stalking when the person both purposefully engages in a course
 13 13 of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a
 13 14 reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated,
 13 15 or threatened or to fear that the person intends to cause
 13 16 bodily injury to, or the death of, that specific person or a
 13 17 member of the specific person's immediate family and the person
 13 18 has knowledge or should have knowledge that a reasonable person
 13 19 would feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened
 13 20 or fear that the person intends to cause bodily injury to, or
 13 21 the death of, that specific person or a member of the specific
 13 22 person's immediate family. The bill eliminates a current
 13 23 element of stalking requiring the person's course of conduct to
 13 24 actually induce fear in the victim of bodily injury to or death
 13 25 of the victim or the victim's family member.
 13 26    A person who commits stalking in violation of Code section
 13 27 708.11 is subject to criminal penalties ranging from an
 13 28 aggravated misdemeanor (confinement for no more than two years
 13 29 and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250) to a class
 13 30 "C" felony (confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of

 13 34 positioning device, when, with intent to intimidate, annoy, or
 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global
 14  5 positioning device commits a serious misdemeanor.  A serious
 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one

 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
 14 18 domestic relationship.  Changing an offense from a category
 14 19 "A" sentence to a category "B" sentence in effect reduces the
 14 20 maximum accumulation of earned time from one and two=tenths
 14 21 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and

 13 32    UNAUTHORIZED PLACEMENT OF GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICE.  Under

 13 35 alarm another person, the person, without the consent of the
 14  1 other person, places a global positioning device on the other
 14  2 person or an object in order to track the movements of the
 14  3 other person without a legitimate purpose.
 14  4    A person who commits unauthorized placement of a global

 14  6 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than one
 14  7 year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.

 14 11 or subsequent offense of domestic abuse assault in Code section
 14 12 708.2A(4); harassment in the first degree in Code section
 14 13 708.7(2), if the offense involved a domestic relationship
 14 14 and the sentence by the court exceeds one year; a third or
 14 15 subsequent offense of stalking under Code section 708.11(3)(a),
 14 16 if the offense involved a domestic relationship; and stalking
 14 17 under Code section 708.11(3)(b)(1), if the offense involved a
