  1 10 otherwise requires:
  1 11    a.  "Applicable percentage" means that percentage, not
  1 12 greater than one hundred percentage points, equal to fifty=two
  1 13 percentage points plus two percentage points for each month for

  1 16 plan.
  1 17    b.  "Drop benefit" means, for a participant, an amount
  1 18 credited to the participant's account each applicable month
  1 19 equal to the member's applicable percentage multiplied by the
  1 20 member's participant retirement amount.
  1 21    c.  "Eligible member" means a member, as defined in section
  1 22 97B.50A, who has attained fifty=five years of age with at least

  1 25 maintained by the system reflecting the participant's

  1 27    e.  "Participant retirement amount" means the amount equal to

  1 29 received under section 97B.49B or 97B.49C, as applicable, if
  1 30 the member retired on the date the eligible member commenced
  1 31 participation in the plan, based on earnings through the
  1 32 previous full quarter of covered wages earned by the member.
  1 33    f.  "Plan" means the deferred retirement option plan
  1 34 established by this section.
  1 35    g.  "Plan eligibility month" means the first full calendar
  2  1 month in which the participant is an eligible member.
  2  2    2.  a.  An eligible member may elect to participate in the
  2  3 deferred retirement option plan as provided in this section.
  2  4 A decision by an eligible member to participate in the plan
  2  5 is irrevocable.  Upon commencing membership in the plan, the
  2  6 member shall remain an active member of the system and shall
  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited
  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a
  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired

  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP

  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have

  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  1 17    b.  "Drop benefit" means, for a participant, an amount
  1 18 credited to the participant's account each applicable month

  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates

  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional

  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive

  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall

  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.

  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the

  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired

  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible

  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.

  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the

  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial

  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.

  2  3 deferred retirement option plan as provided in this section.
  2  4 A decision by an eligible member to participate in the plan
  2  5 is irrevocable.  Upon commencing membership in the plan, the
  2  6 member shall remain an active member of the system and shall
  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited
  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a
  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive

  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible

  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The

  2  4 A decision by an eligible member to participate in the plan
  2  5 is irrevocable.  Upon commencing membership in the plan, the
  2  6 member shall remain an active member of the system and shall
  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited
  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a

  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation

  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under

  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan

  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the

  2  3 deferred retirement option plan as provided in this section.
  2  4 A decision by an eligible member to participate in the plan
  2  5 is irrevocable.  Upon commencing membership in the plan, the
  2  6 member shall remain an active member of the system and shall
  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited

  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.

  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the

  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.

  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,

  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired

  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional

  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while

  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.

  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.

  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay

  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons

  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A

  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the

  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in

  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2  3 deferred retirement option plan as provided in this section.
  2  4 A decision by an eligible member to participate in the plan
  2  5 is irrevocable.  Upon commencing membership in the plan, the

  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited

  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the

  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.

  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.

  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,

  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan

  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP

  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of

  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.

  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The

  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with

  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the

  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

       ec/rn
  2  5 is irrevocable.  Upon commencing membership in the plan, the
  2  6 member shall remain an active member of the system and shall
  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited
  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a
  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2  6 member shall remain an active member of the system and shall
  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited
  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a
  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2  7 have credited to a participant account on behalf of the member
  2  8 from the retirement fund for each month the member participates
  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited
  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a
  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost

  2  9 in the plan the member's drop benefit. The amounts credited
  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a
  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 10 shall be invested by the system in risk=free assets of a
  2 11 short=term nature and interest and earnings shall not be
  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired

  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.

  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall

  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the

  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund

  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 12 credited to the member's participant account but shall remain
  2 13 with the retirement fund established in section 97B.7.
  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional

  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.

  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then

  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.

  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,

  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the

  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.

  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 14    b.  Upon termination of an eligible member's participation
  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,

  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 15 in the plan, the eligible member shall be deemed to be retired
  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.
  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 16 under the system as of that date for purposes of the system
  2 17 and shall begin receiving a retirement allowance equal to
  2 18 the member's participant retirement amount or such optional
  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial
  3 26 cost to the system.  If the actuary determines that the plan
  3 27 has resulted in an increased actuarial cost to the system,
  3 28 then, notwithstanding any provision of section 97B.11 to the
  3 29 contrary, the system shall increase the members' contribution
  3 30 rate as necessary to cover the increased cost of the plan
  3 31 created in this section.

  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional

  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of

  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with

  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 19 retirement benefits, based upon that amount, pursuant to
  2 20 section 97B.51.  In addition, the eligible member shall receive
  2 21 the moneys credited to the member's participant account while
  2 22 participating in the plan.  The eligible member shall select,
  2 23 upon written application to the system, whether to receive
  2 24 the amount in the member's participant account in the form
  2 25 of a lump sum distribution or as a rollover to an eligible
  2 26 retirement plan as defined in section 97B.53B.
  2 27    c.  If an eligible member terminates participation in the
  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then
  2 31 the system shall assess a twenty=five percent penalty on the
  2 32 amount credited to the member's participant account prior to
  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.
  2 35    3.  To participate in the plan, an eligible member shall
  3  1 make written application to the system.  The application shall
  3  2 include the following:
  3  3    a.  The month the eligible member intends to commence
  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member
  3  8 commences membership in the plan.  However, for the two=year
  3  9 period beginning with the first of the month following the
  3 10 implementation date of this section, an eligible member between
  3 11 sixty=two and sixty=four years of age may also select a plan
  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund
  3 20 and shall not be subject to a refund of contributions under
  3 21 section 97B.53.
  3 22    5.  The system's actuary, while making the annual valuation
  3 23 of the assets and liabilities of the retirement system, shall
  3 24 determine whether establishment and operation of the plan
  3 25 created in this section has resulted in an increased actuarial

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with

  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  2 28 plan prior to the date selected by the member upon commencing
  2 29 membership in the plan and the termination is not due to the
  2 30 death or disability of the member under this chapter, then

  2 33 distributing the amount to the member.  The penalty amount
  2 34 shall be transferred to and remain with the retirement fund.

  3 12 termination date that is one or two years after the date the
  3 13 eligible member commences membership in the plan.
  3 14    4.  Participation in the plan by an eligible member does not
  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund

  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  3 15 guarantee continued employment.  Contributions required from
  3 16 members and participating cities shall continue based on the
  3 17 earnable compensation of an eligible member participating in
  3 18 the plan.  However, contributions made while an eligible member
  3 19 participates in the plan shall remain with the retirement fund

  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category

  3  4 participation in the plan.
  3  5    b.  The eligible member's selection of a plan termination
  3  6 date.  The plan termination date shall be either three,
  3  7 four, or five years after the date the eligible member

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.

  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.

  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have

  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.

  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay

  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with

  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost

  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the

  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member

  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with

  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill concerns special services members of the Iowa
  4  1 public employees' retirement system (IPERS) created in Code
  4  2 chapter 97B.
  4  3    Code section 97B.49B is amended to provide that persons
  4  4 employed as a public safety telecommunicator that are not
  4  5 otherwise a member of the retirement system in Code chapter 97A
  4  6 or 411 are included within the protection occupation category
  4  7 of IPERS.
  4  8    New Code section 97B.50B establishes a deferred retirement
  4  9 option plan (DROP) for special service members of IPERS.
  4 10    The new Code section provides that special service members
  4 11 of IPERS who are at least 55 years of age and have at least
  4 12 22 years of service are eligible to participate in the DROP
  4 13 plan. The DROP plan provides that an eligible member can delay
  4 14 retirement, continue working for a set number of additional
  4 15 years, and have a portion of the retirement allowance they
  4 16 otherwise would have received if they had retired instead of
  4 17 participating in the DROP plan deposited in an account that is
  4 18 then distributed to them when they eventually retire. However,
  4 19 the member's retirement allowance is set at the time the member
  4 20 enters the DROP plan.
  4 21    Prior to participating in the DROP plan, a member shall
  4 22 submit an application to the system indicating when they intend
  4 23 to start participation in the DROP plan and when they intend
  4 24 to terminate their participation in the plan and retire. The
  4 25 bill permits an eligible member to elect to participate in the
  4 26 DROP plan for three, four, or five years. However, for the
  4 27 two=year period beginning on the implementation date of this
  4 28 Code section, an eligible member between the ages of 62 and 64
  4 29 can elect to participate in the DROP plan and terminate their
  4 30 participation in one or two years.
  4 31    Upon electing to participate in the DROP plan, the eligible
  4 32 member continues to work but has a portion of the retirement
  4 33 allowance they would have received if they had decided to
  4 34 retire credited to an account. The amount credited is equal
  4 35 to a percentage of the retirement allowance they would have
  5  1 received. The percentage rate is determined by starting with
  5  2 52 percent and adding 2 percent per month, up to a maximum of
  5  3 100 percent, based upon the number of months between the month
  5  4 the member first became eligible to participate in the DROP
  5  5 plan and the month the member actually participates. The bill
  5  6 provides that the amount deposited in the member's account does
  5  7 not accrue interest or dividends. Upon termination from the
  5  8 DROP plan, the eligible member begins to receive a retirement
  5  9 allowance based upon the amount the member would have received
  5 10 when the member commenced participation in the DROP plan plus
  5 11 the amount in the member's account. If the member terminates
  5 12 participation in the plan prior to the date set by the member
  5 13 and the termination is not due to the member's death or
  5 14 disability, IPERS shall withhold 25 percent of the amount in
  5 15 the account as a penalty. The bill provides that participation
  5 16 in the DROP plan does not guarantee continued employment.
  5 17    The new Code section also provides that if the IPERS actuary
  5 18 determines that the DROP plan has increased the actuarial cost
  5 19 of the system, the contribution rate paid by special service
  5 20 members shall be increased to cover this increased cost.
