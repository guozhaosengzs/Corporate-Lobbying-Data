  6 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 24    Code section 282.18 governs the criteria and procedures
  6 25 for open enrollment of students between school districts
  6 26 initiated by parents and guardians. Under this bill, for
  6 27 school years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, if the parent
  6 28 or guardian of a pupil requesting open enrollment is the owner
  6 29 of a homestead located in the district of residence, the
  6 30 notification of intent to open enroll sent by the parent or
  6 31 guardian to the district of residence shall be accompanied by
  6 32 a property tax equalization fee. The amount of the property
  6 33 tax equalization fee is an amount equal to the assessed value
  6 34 of the parent or guardian's homestead located in the district
  6 35 of residence for the fiscal year prior to the school year for
  7  1 which open enrollment is requested multiplied by an amount
  7  2 equal to the consolidated levy rate in the receiving district
  7  3 for the same fiscal year minus the consolidated levy rate in
  7  4 the district of residence for the same fiscal year. If the
  7  5 amount of the property tax equalization fee is zero or less, a
  7  6 property tax equalization fee is not required to be paid by the
  7  7 parent or guardian. However, when the amount of the property
  7  8 tax equalization fee calculated is less than zero, the parent
  7  9 or guardian shall receive a property tax equalization refund
  7 10 from the receiving district in an amount equal to the number of
  7 11 dollars that the property tax equalization fee was calculated
  7 12 to be less than zero.
  7 13    If the open enrollment request is granted, the district
  7 14 of residence pays the property tax equalization fee received
  7 15 from the parent or guardian to the receiving district along
  7 16 with other amounts specified by current law. At the same time
  7 17 the district of residence pays the specified sums of funding
  7 18 to the receiving district, the receiving district shall pay
  7 19 to the pupil's parent or guardian, from such sums received,
  7 20 the property tax equalization refund amount, if applicable.
  7 21 The property tax equalization fee must be paid annually to
  7 22 the district of residence by the parent or guardian of a
  7 23 child participating in open enrollment.  If the request for
  7 24 open enrollment is for more than one year, the fee shall be
  7 25 calculated each year and paid in the manner provided in the
  7 26 bill. Unless the parent or guardian has children open enrolled
  7 27 in more than one receiving district during a school year, a
  7 28 parent or guardian is only required to pay one property tax
  7 29 equalization fee each school year regardless of the number of
  7 30 the parent's or guardian's children who are open enrolled to a
  7 31 receiving district.
  7 32    The bill also provides that the withdrawal of an open
  7 33 enrollment request by the parent or guardian or the denial of a
  7 34 request, and upon conclusion of any appeals resulting from such
  7 35 denial, results in a refund of the property tax equalization
