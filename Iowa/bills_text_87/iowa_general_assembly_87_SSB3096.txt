S.F.
_____


governing
the
wholesale
distribution
of
drugs.
1


The
bill
modifies
the
composition
of
the
board
of
pharmacy
by
2


adding
a
registered,
certified
pharmacy
technician
as
a
member
3


of
the
board.
4


The
bill
also
alters
the
laws
governing
the
wholesale
5


distribution
of
drugs.
Congress
enacted
the
federal
Drug
6


Quality
and
Security
Act
(DQSA)
in
2013.
Title
II
of
the
7


DQSA
included
the
federal
Drug
Supply
Chain
Security
Act
8


(DSCSA)
which
created
new
standards
for
the
distribution
of
9


prescription
drugs
and
devices,
including
prescription
drugs
10


defined
as
products
under
the
DSCSA,
to
ensure
prescription
11


drug
and
device
quality.
The
bill
updates
Code
chapter
155A
12


to
be
in
compliance
with
the
DSCSA,
which
also
contains
a
13


provision
that
prohibits
states
from
enacting
laws
that
are
14


more
or
less
strict
than
the
DSCSA.
15


The
board
of
pharmacy
currently
licenses
many
types
of
drug
16


distributors
under
a
single
wholesale
distributor
license.
17


Under
the
DSCSA,
entities
engaged
in
the
wholesale
distribution
18


of
prescription
drugs
are
held
to
a
higher
minimum
standard
19


than
entities
engaged
in
other
drug
distribution
activities.
20


The
bill
creates
specific
license
categories
for
third-party
21


logistics
providers,
limited
distributors,
and
wholesale
22


distributors
to
shield
entities
exempt
from
DSCSA
from
the
23


standards
required
of
wholesale
distributors
under
federal
24


law.
The
bill
grants
the
board
authority
to
deny,
suspend,
25


or
revoke
licenses
for
third-party
logistics
providers,
26


limited
distributors,
and
wholesale
distributors,
or
otherwise


27


discipline
such
providers,
limited
distributors,
and
wholesale
28


distributors.
