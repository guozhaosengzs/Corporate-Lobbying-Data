requiring
a
permit.
1


Code
section

requires
a
firm
issued
a

the
licensee
or
person
with
a
practice
3


privilege
who
is
responsible
for
the
firm’s
licensure
and

legal

The
bill
replaces

5


privilege”
with
“nonlicensee”.
6


Code
section
542.8(12)(b)
lists
the
conditions
required
for
7


a
licensed
public
accounting
(LPA)
firm
to

The
bill
requires
a

good
9


moral

an
12


accountant’s
report
on
financial
statements
on
behalf
of
an
LPA
13


firm

The

15


additional
competency
requirements.
16


Code
section
542.20(5)
lists
the

18


a

required
for
a

Code
section
542.20(6)(c),
27


a
person
who
provides
attest
services
in
Iowa
must
practice
28


through
an
Iowa-licensed
CPA
firm.
The
bill
broadens
the
types
29


of
attesting
services
applicable
in
such
condition,
and
allows
30


a
person
to
also
practice
through
a
CPA
firm
that
is
validly
31


licensed
in
the
state
of
its
principal
place
of

peer
review
requirements.
