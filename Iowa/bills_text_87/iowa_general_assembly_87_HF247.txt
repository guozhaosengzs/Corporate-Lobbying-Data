  9  1 under section 53.2 shall receive an absentee ballot for all
  9  2 subsequent elections in which that person is eligible to vote
  9  3 and qualifies under section 53.1, unless the registered voter
  9  4 requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
  9  5 elections.  The state commissioner shall provide a check box
  9  6 on the prescribed form for this purpose.  For all subsequent
  9  7 elections, the county commissioner of elections shall
  9  8 automatically mail an absentee ballot to the requesting voter,
  9  9 or automatically mail or deliver an absentee ballot if the
  9 10 requester is a person voting pursuant to section 53.22.  A
  9 11 voter's status as an ongoing absentee voter shall be terminated
  9 12 upon the request of the voter or by the county commissioner
  9 13 if the voter fails to qualify under section 53.1 or if the
  9 14 voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive general
  9 15 elections.
  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9  2 subsequent elections in which that person is eligible to vote
  9  3 and qualifies under section 53.1, unless the registered voter
  9  4 requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
  9  5 elections.  The state commissioner shall provide a check box
  9  6 on the prescribed form for this purpose.  For all subsequent
  9  7 elections, the county commissioner of elections shall
  9  8 automatically mail an absentee ballot to the requesting voter,
  9  9 or automatically mail or deliver an absentee ballot if the
  9 10 requester is a person voting pursuant to section 53.22.  A
  9 11 voter's status as an ongoing absentee voter shall be terminated
  9 12 upon the request of the voter or by the county commissioner
  9 13 if the voter fails to qualify under section 53.1 or if the
  9 14 voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive general
  9 15 elections.
  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without

  9  6 on the prescribed form for this purpose.  For all subsequent
  9  7 elections, the county commissioner of elections shall
  9  8 automatically mail an absentee ballot to the requesting voter,
  9  9 or automatically mail or deliver an absentee ballot if the
  9 10 requester is a person voting pursuant to section 53.22.  A
  9 11 voter's status as an ongoing absentee voter shall be terminated

  9 13 if the voter fails to qualify under section 53.1 or if the
  9 14 voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive general
  9 15 elections.
  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's

  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the

 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the

 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by

 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive

  9  9 or automatically mail or deliver an absentee ballot if the

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by

 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,

  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper

 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required

  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by

 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section

 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 16                           EXPLANATION
  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper

 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to

 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with

 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive

  9 19    This bill relates to elections by providing for the
  9 20 registration of eligible electors upon review of electronic
  9 21 records received from state agencies and providing for ongoing
  9 22 absentee voter status.
  9 23    Division I of the bill relates to voter registration by
  9 24 allowing registration of eligible electors to vote following
  9 25 review of electronic records received from driver's license
  9 26 and nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  9 27 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  9 28    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9 29 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9 30 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9 31 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9 32 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9 33 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 34 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required

 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with

 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to

 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is

 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as

 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.

 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by

 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section

 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to

 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is

 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.

 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive

 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.
 12 19    Division I of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered
 12 23 voter requests not to receive an absentee ballot for subsequent
 12 24 elections.  A person's status as an ongoing absentee voter can
 12 25 be terminated by that person, by the county commissioner of
 12 26 elections if the person fails to qualify as an absentee voter,
 12 27 or if the voter subsequently fails to vote in two consecutive
 12 28 general elections.

  9 35 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
 10  1 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
 10  2 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
 10  3 social security number, and other information. Under current
 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

 10  4 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
 10  5 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
 10  6 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
 10  7 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
 10  8 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
 10  9 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
 10 10 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
 10 11 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
 10 12 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
 10 13 state department of transportation.
 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
 10 15 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
 10 16 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
 10 17 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
 10 21 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
 10 22 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
 10 23 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
 10 24 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10 25 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10 31 required by current law.
 10 32    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10 33 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 34 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 35 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 11  1 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 11  2 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 11  5 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 11  6 person submitting an application for a license or card will
 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 11  9    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 11 10 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 11 11 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 11 12 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 11 13 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 11 14 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 11 17 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 11 18 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 11 19 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 11 20 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic
 12  5 voter registration be completed by other state agencies with
 12  6 direct client contact that collect personal client information
 12  7 sufficient to complete a voter registration application.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 12  9 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 12 10 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 12 11 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 12 12    Division I of the bill may include a state mandate as defined
 12 13 in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code
 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.

 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered

 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms

 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 35 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 12  1 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 12  2 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 12  3 to be established by the state commission.
 12  4    The bill makes corresponding changes requiring automatic

 11 21    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 11 22 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 11 23 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 11 24 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11 29 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11 30 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11 31 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is

 12 14 section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political
 12 15 subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for
 12 16 the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified.
 12 17 Therefore, political subdivisions are required to comply with
 12 18 any state mandate included in the bill.

 12 20    Division II of the bill requires that an absentee voter
 12 21 receive absentee ballots for all subsequent elections without
 12 22 having to reapply before each election unless the registered

 10 14    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit

 10 18 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
 10 19 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
 10 20 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector

 10 26 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10 27 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10 28 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10 29 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10 30 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as

 11 15 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 11 16 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section

 11 25 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11 26 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11 27 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11 28 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to

 11 32 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11 33 registrar of voters.
 11 34    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is

 11  3 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 11  4 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute

 11  7 not be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under
 11  8 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
