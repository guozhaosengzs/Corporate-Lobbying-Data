and
the
approval
1


of
any

all

given
by
fiduciaries
in
the
discharge
of
2


their
duties.
The
bill
eliminates
the
duty
to
admit
wills
3


of
decedents
to
probate,
when
not
contested,
and
to
make
4


necessary
orders
in
relation
thereto,
including
orders
to
issue
5


commissions
to
take
depositions.
It
eliminates
the
duty
to
6


make
all
necessary
orders
in
relation
to
the
personal
effects
7


of
a
deceased
person,
where
no
objection
is
filed,
and
perform
8


all
other
acts
within
the
clerk’s
jurisdiction,
as
provided
in
9


the
probate
code.
The
bill
eliminates
the
duty
to
approve,
10


when
notice
has
been
waived
by
all
persons
interested,
of
11


petitions

petitions
and
reports,
in
12

mortgage,
pledge,
lease,

14


Under
Code
section
633.22,
the
clerk
retains
the
power
to
15


examine
and
approve
all
intermediate
and
interlocutory
accounts
16


and
reports
of
fiduciaries.
However,
the

such

Code
chapter
633
and
that
the
18


clerk
may
convert
and
close
small
estates
under
Code
chapter
19


635.
The

continues
to
have
the
ability
to
enter
routine
20


scheduling
orders
in
probate
matters
as
established
by
the
21


chief
judge
of
the
judicial
district.
22


The
bill
amends
Code
section
633.27
to
provide
that
the
23


clerk
no
longer
keeps
the
probate
docket
as
a
book,
but
rather
24


as
an
electronic
record.
The
probate
docket
must,
among
other
25


things,
name
all
heirs
in
intestate
estates
and
the
surviving
26


spouse
of
each
deceased
intestate,
and
show
whether
each
27


person
is
an
adult
or
a
minor,
and
each
person’s
residence.
28


Currently,
the
probate
docket
must
include
such
persons’
29


precise
ages,
not
categorically
whether
such
persons
are
adults
30


or
minors.
The
probate
docket
will
no
longer
be
required
to
31


indicate
the
volume
and
page
of
a
real
estate
record
in
light
32


of
the
nature
of
electronic
records.
33


The
bill
amends
Code
section
633.42
to
require
that
the
34


requests
