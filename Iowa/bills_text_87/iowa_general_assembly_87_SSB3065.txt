be
19


partitioned
by
sale.
Partition
of
real
and
personal
property
20


owned
by
the
same
person
may
be
partitioned
in
the
same
21


partition
action.
Property
may
be
partitioned
by
both
sale
and
22


in
kind
in
the
same
partition
action.
Property
that
has
been
23


partitioned
in
kind,
or
the
proceeds
from
a
partition
by
sale,
24


are
subject
to
an
order
of
the

appoint
three
referees
for
a
1


partition
in
kind
and
one
or
more
referees
for
a
partition
by

sale.
The
court
shall
order
an
appraisal
conducted
by
three
3


disinterested
persons
with
knowledge
of
property
valuations,
or
4


by
a
different
method
of
valuation
as
agreed
to
by
the
owners

of
the

Currently,
the
court
is
not
required
to
order
6


an
appraisal
for
a
partition
in
kind,
and
for
a
partition
by
7


sale
the
appraisal
is
to
be
conducted
by
three
disinterested
8


freeholders.
The
bill
requires
the
court
to
direct
the
referee
9


to
file
a
report
setting
forth
the
referee’s
recommendations
10


for
completing
the
partition.
A
referee’s
report
is
not
11


currently
required
to
be
filed
with
the
court.
12


For
a
partition
in
kind,
the
bill
allows
the
referee
to
13


include
owelty
as
part
of
the
referee’s
recommendation.
The
14


bill
defines
owelty
as
an
equitable
remedy
used
in
partition
15


actions
to
equalize
the
lower
value
of
property
received
by
16


a
party
through
the
payment
of
moneys
from
a
recipient
of
a
17


higher
value
property.
Owelty
is
not
currently
allowed
in
18


partition
actions.
The
court
may
approve
or
disapprove
the
19


referee’s
report,
or
order
the
property
sold
by
partition
by
20


sale.
If
the
court
approves
owelty
payments,
the
partition
in
21


kind
cannot
be
completed
until
all
owelty
payments
have
been
22


made.
23


Upon
approving
a
partition
in
kind,
the
court
shall
file
a
24


decree
describing
each
parcel
of
real
property
or
article
of
25


personal
property
allotted
to
each
owner
and
enter
judgment
26


against
each
property
owner
for
their
apportioned
costs
of
the
27


action.
A
certified
copy
of
the
decree
shall
be
filed
with
the
28


county
recorder
and
a
copy
provided
to
the
county
auditor
in
29


each
county
where
the
partitioned
property
is
located.
30


The
bill
requires
the
referee
to
file
a
report
with
the
court
31


if
the
referee
is
unable
to
make
a
partition
in
kind
as
ordered
32


by
the
court.
If
such
partition
involves
personal
property,
33


the
court
shall
order
a
sale
of
the
property
without
further
34


notice.

a

No

action,
19


the
plaintiff’s
attorney
fees
related
to
such
contest
shall

and
attorneys
involved
in
a

The
bill
requires
that
such

costs.
The

shall
have
a

In
a
partition
action
involving
heirs
property
in
which
a
1


cotenant
has
requested
partition
in
kind,
the
bill
requires
2


the
court
to
issue
an
initial
decree
appointing
a
referee
and
3


ordering
an
appraisal.
After
the
referee
files
the
appraisal,
4


the
court
must
conduct
a
hearing
to
determine
the
fair
market
5


value
of
the
heirs
property.
After
the
hearing
the
court
6


must
send
notice
of
the
fair
market
value
to
all
cotenants
of
7


the
heirs
property.
If
at
that
time
a
cotenant
requests
that
8


the
heirs
property
be
partitioned
by
sale,
the
bill
allows
9


all
other
cotenants
to
elect
to
purchase
the
interest
of
a
10


cotenant
that
has
requested
partition
by
sale
of
the
heirs
11


property.
The
bill
provides
a
specific
time
period
in
which
12


a
cotenant
has
to
elect
to
purchase
such
interest,
provides
13


a
determination
of
fractional
ownership
of
each
cotenant’s
14


interest
in
the
heirs
property
before
and
after
purchase
of
15


such
interest,
provides
the
time
frame
for
a
cotenant
to
16


pay
for
an
interest
such
cotenant
has
elected
to
purchase
17


from
another
cotenant,
and
provides
for
reallocation
of
18


all
cotenants’
interests
in
the
heirs
property
based
on
the
19


payments
made,
or
not
made,
by
the
electing
cotenants.
20


The
bill
allows
a
cotenant
to
petition
the
court
to
authorize
21


the
sale
of
the
interest
of
a
cotenant
named
as
a
defendant
22


in
the
action
who
does
not
appear
in
the
action.
If
the
23


court
authorizes
such
sale,
the
value
of
the
interest
of
the
24


nonappearing
cotenant
shall
be
determined
by
the
court.
25


If
all
payments
are
made
by
the
electing
cotenants,
the
26


court
shall
order
the
heirs
property
to
be
partitioned
in
kind
27


unless
the
court
determines
that
a
partition
in
kind
will
28


result
in
great
prejudice
to
the
cotenants
as
a
group.
The
29


court
is
required
to
consider
the
totality
of
eight
factors
30


as
detailed
in
the
bill
in
making
such
a
determination.
If
31


the
court
orders
the
heirs
property
to
be
partitioned
in
32


kind,
the
partition
shall
be
conducted
per
the
partition
in
33


kind
procedures
detailed
in
the
general
provisions
of
the
34


new
Code
chapter.
If
the
court
orders
the
heirs
property

directs
