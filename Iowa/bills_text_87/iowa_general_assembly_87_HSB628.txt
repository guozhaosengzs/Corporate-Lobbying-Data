Office
of

13


——
findings
and
intent.
14


1.
a.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
many
adults
15


in
this
state
are
unable
to
meet
essential
requirements
16


to
maintain
their
physical
health
or
to
manage
essential
17


aspects
of
their
financial
resources
and
are
in
need
of
18


substitute
decision-making


guardianship,
conservatorship,
19


or
representative
payee
services.
However,
a
willing
20


and
responsible
person
may
not
be
available
to
serve
as
a
21


private
substitute
decision
maker


guardian,
conservator,
or
22


representative
payee


or
the
adult
may
not
have
adequate
income
23


or
resources
to
compensate
a
private
substitute
decision
maker
24


guardian,
conservator,
or
representative
payee
.
25


b.
The
general
assembly
further
finds
that
a
process
26


should
exist
to
assist
individuals
in
finding
alternatives
27


to
substitute
decision-making
guardianship,
conservatorship,
28


or
representative
payee
services
and
less
intrusive
means
of
29


assistance
before
an
individual’s
independence
or
rights
are
30


limited.


31


c.


The
general
assembly
further
finds
that
a
substitute
32


decision
maker
may
be
necessary
to
finalize
a
person’s
affairs
33


after
death
when
there
is
no
willing
and
appropriate
person


34


available
to
serve
as
the
person’s
personal
representative.
