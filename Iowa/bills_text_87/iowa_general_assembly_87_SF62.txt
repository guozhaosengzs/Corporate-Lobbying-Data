 12 18                           EXPLANATION
 12 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 21    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12 22    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12 23 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.
 16  8    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 16  9 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 16 10 effective immediately upon filing.
 16 11    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.

 12 18                           EXPLANATION
 12 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 21    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12 22    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12 23 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.
 16  8    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency

 12 18                           EXPLANATION
 12 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 21    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12 22    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12 23 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.
 16  8    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 16  9 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 16 10 effective immediately upon filing.

 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected

 12 18                           EXPLANATION
 12 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 21    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12 22    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12 23 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.

 12 17 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 12 18                           EXPLANATION
 12 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 21    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12 22    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12 23 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.
 16  8    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 16  9 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 12 18                           EXPLANATION
 12 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 21    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12 22    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12 23 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the

 14 33 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability

 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple

 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or

 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,

 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the

 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or

 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected

 12 18                           EXPLANATION
 12 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 21    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12 22    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12 23 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's

 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,

 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use

 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner

 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides

 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at

 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to

 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement

 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The

 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or

 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.

 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.

 12 24 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12 25 of fireworks.
 12 26    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12 27 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12 28 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 29 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 32 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or

 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.
 16  8    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 16  9 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 12 30 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 31 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 32 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 33 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 34 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 35 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 13  1 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 13  2 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 13  3 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 13  4 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 13  5 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 13  6 substance with limited exceptions.
 13  7    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 13  8 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 13  9 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 13 10 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 13 11    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 13 12 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 13 13 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 13 14 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 13 15 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 13 16 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 13 17 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 13 18 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 13 19 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13 20 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13 21 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13 22 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13 23 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13 24 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13 25 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13 26 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13 27 fireworks.
 13 28    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 29 to establish standards for licensed retailers and community
 13 30 groups to offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with
 13 31 specified industry standards. The bill also requires that
 13 32 retailers and community groups provide proof of and maintain
 13 33 public liability and product liability insurance. Under the
 13 34 bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt rules to
 13 35 permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell consumer
 14  1 fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between May 20 and
 14  2 July 6 and between December 10 and January 3 each year and at
 14  3 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 6 each
 14  4 year.
 14  5    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 14  6 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 14  7 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 14  8 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 14  9 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 14 14 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 14 15 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 14 16 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 14 17    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 14 18 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 14 19 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 14 20 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14 21 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14 22 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14 23 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14 24 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14 25    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14 26 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14 27 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14 28 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14 29 than $625, or by both.
 14 30    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 31 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the

 14 34 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 35 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 15  1 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 15  2 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 15  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 15  4 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 15  5    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 15  6 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 15  7 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 15  8 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 15  9 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 15 10 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 15 11 of at least $250.
 15 12    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 15 13 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 15 14 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 15 15 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 15 16 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 15 17 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 15 18 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 15 19 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 15 20 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 15 21 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 15 22 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 15 23 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 15 24 $250.
 15 25    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 26 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 15 27 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15 28 24 through July 6 and December 24 through January 3 of each
 15 29 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15 30 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15 31 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15 32 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15 33 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15 34 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15 35 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 16  1 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 16  2 imprisonment for such a violation.
 16  3    The bill requires the department of revenue to transfer an
 16  4 amount equal to the portion of the sales tax receipts collected
 16  5 from the sale of consumer fireworks to the department of public
 16  6 safety peace officers' retirement, accident, and disability
 16  7 system described in Code section 97A.8.
 16  8    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 16  9 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 16 10 effective immediately upon filing.
 16 11    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 14 10 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 14 11 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 14 12 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 14 13 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
