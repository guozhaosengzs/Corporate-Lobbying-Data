H.F.
_____


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
relates
to
governmental
ethics
and
the
regulation
2


of
lobbyists
and
gifts.
3


Currently,
the
definition
of
“lobbyist”
includes
eight
4


exceptions.
One
of
the
exceptions
provides
that
a
person
is
5


not
a
lobbyist
if
the
person
is
an
individual
who
is
a
member,
6


director,
trustee,
officer,
or
committee
member
of
a
business,
7


trade,
labor,
farm,
professional,
religious,
education,
or
8


charitable
association,
foundation,
or
organization
who
either
9


is
not
paid
compensation
or
is
not
specifically
designated
as
10


a
lobbyist.
The
bill,
in
order
for
the
exception
to
apply,
11


requires
the
person
to
both
not
be
paid
compensation
and
not
be
12


specifically
designated
as
a
lobbyist.
13


The
bill
amends
two
exceptions
to
the
gift
law
by
eliminating
14


wording
redundancies.
