  3 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 18    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill amends provisions in Code
  3 19 chapter 468 which authorize a board of supervisors (board) to
  3 20 establish and maintain a pumping station (station) that is part
  3 21 of a drainage or levee district (district) in order to provide
  3 22 an outlet for affected property (Code chapter 468, subchapter
  3 23 II, part 5).  The bill provides that a board must proceed to
  3 24 establish a station or divide a station when it receives a
  3 25 petition by one or more owners of land to be benefited by the
  3 26 station.  The board provides for its establishment in the same
  3 27 manner as if it were establishing the original district.  The
  3 28 petition is subject to remonstrance and land contiguous to
  3 29 the district may be annexed. The bill provides that a board
  3 30 provide for the repair and maintenance of a pumping plant
  3 31 in the same manner as other improvements. It eliminates a
  3 32 provision that limits the cost of repairs to 25 percent of the
  3 33 improvement's original cost.
  3 34    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, a board cannot establish a
  3 35 pumping station or divide a pumping station unless it receives
  4  1 a petition from at least one=third of the benefited property
  4  2 owners in that district.  The board is authorized to annex
  4  3 additional land after the completion of any improvements unless
  4  4 one=third of the owners of the proposed land to be annexed
  4  5 objects.
  4  6    Code section 468.126 governs procedures for letting out
  4  7 work involving repairs to an improvement.  If the estimated
  4  8 cost does not exceed $50,000, the board may order the work
  4  9 done without conducting a hearing on the matter. Otherwise,
  4 10 the board must set a date for a hearing and provide notice
  4 11 of the hearing to landowners in the district by publication.
  4 12 If the estimated cost of the repair exceeds an adjusted
  4 13 competitive bid threshold  established by the state department
  4 14 of transportation (Code section 314.1B), the board must provide
  4 15 notice to the landowners in the same manner as when a district
  4 16 is established, including by publication, certified mail, or
  4 17 personal service (Code sections 468.14 through 468.18).

  4  1 a petition from at least one=third of the benefited property
  4  2 owners in that district.  The board is authorized to annex
  4  3 additional land after the completion of any improvements unless
  4  4 one=third of the owners of the proposed land to be annexed
  4  5 objects.
  4  6    Code section 468.126 governs procedures for letting out
  4  7 work involving repairs to an improvement.  If the estimated
  4  8 cost does not exceed $50,000, the board may order the work
  4  9 done without conducting a hearing on the matter. Otherwise,
  4 10 the board must set a date for a hearing and provide notice
  4 11 of the hearing to landowners in the district by publication.
  4 12 If the estimated cost of the repair exceeds an adjusted
  4 13 competitive bid threshold  established by the state department
  4 14 of transportation (Code section 314.1B), the board must provide
  4 15 notice to the landowners in the same manner as when a district
  4 16 is established, including by publication, certified mail, or
