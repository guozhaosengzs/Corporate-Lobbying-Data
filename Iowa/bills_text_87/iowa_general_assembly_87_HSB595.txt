The

from
adopting
an

plan
that
results
in

projected
annual
costs
in
excess

2
percent
of
the
utility’s

revenue.
In
determining
the

amount,
the
board
shall
exclude
revenues
from

11


receiving
exemptions
from
participation
in

efficiency
12


programs
and
revenues
associated
with

A

propose

If

energy
efficiency
plan
that
exceeds
the
2

threshold
17


amount
on

the
utility
may
file
18


a
request
to
modify
the
energy
efficiency
plan
to
achieve
19


projected
annual
costs
below
the
2

threshold
amount.
20


The
board
shall
promptly
initiate

reasonable

Current

rate-regulated
gas
or
electric
utility
23


to
recover
the
costs
of
energy
efficiency
plans
through
24


automatic
adjustment
mechanisms.
The
bill
requires
the
board
25


to
ensure
that
energy
efficiency
costs
are
recovered
from
all
26


customers
on
a
reasonably
comparable
basis,

The

The
