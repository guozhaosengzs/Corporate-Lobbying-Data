  3 21                           EXPLANATION
  3 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 24    Under current law with the exception of the solar energy
  3 25 system credit in Code section 422.llL, Iowa Code references
  3 26 to the Internal Revenue Code include the Internal Revenue
  3 27 Code in effect on January 1, 2015, meaning federal income tax
  3 28 revisions made by Congress in 2015 and 2016 are not applicable
  3 29 for Iowa tax purposes for 2016 or beyond.  This bill updates
  3 30 the Iowa Code references to the Internal Revenue Code to make
  3 31 those 2015 and 2016 federal income tax revisions applicable
  3 32 for Iowa income tax purposes, and decouples with certain bonus
  3 33 depreciation provisions.
  3 34    DIVISION I ==== INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REFERENCES.   The
  3 35 division amends Code sections 422.3 and 422.32, general
  4  1 definition sections in the chapter of the Code that governs
  4  2 corporate and individual income tax and the franchise tax
  4  3 on financial institutions, to update the references to the
  4  4 Internal Revenue Code.
  4  5    The division amends Code sections 15.335, 422.10, and 422.33
  4  6 to update the references to the Internal Revenue Code for the
  4  7 state research activities credit for individuals, corporations,
  4  8 and corporations participating in certain economic development
  4  9 programs to include the federal changes to the research
  4 10 activities credit and the alternative simplified research
  4 11 activities credit.
  4 12    The division amends Code section 422.11L to update the
  4 13 reference to the Internal Revenue Code for the state solar
  4 14 energy system credit to include federal changes made in 2016
  4 15 to the federal residential energy efficient property credit
  4 16 and the federal energy credit.  This reference to the Internal
  4 17 Revenue Code already includes federal changes made in 2015 to
  4 18 these federal credits (see 2016 Iowa Acts, ch. 1128, {4, 20,
  4 19 and ch. 1138, {40=41).
  4 20    Code section 422.9 provides individuals a deduction from
  4 21 net income for state sales and use taxes if the individual
  4 22 chose to deduct sales and use tax in lieu of state income taxes
  4 23 or the standard deduction for federal income tax purposes.
  4 24 This deduction was set to expire under both federal and Iowa
  4 25 law for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The
  4 26 federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 made
  4 27 the federal deduction permanent.  The division allows the Iowa
  4 28 deduction and makes it permanent for tax years beginning on or
  4 29 after January 1, 2016.
  4 30    Division I takes effect upon enactment and applies
  4 31 retroactively to January 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on
  4 32 or after that date.
  4 33    DIVISION II ==== BONUS DEPRECIATION.  The division decouples,
