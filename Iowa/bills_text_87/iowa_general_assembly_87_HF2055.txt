  6  8                           EXPLANATION
  6  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 11    BACKGROUND.  This bill amends provisions affecting persons
  6 12 who operate dairy farms, including provisions for the
  6 13 processing of milk and the manufacture of milk products, and
  6 14 dairy products on such farms.  The provisions are administered
  6 15 and enforced by the department of agriculture and land
  6 16 stewardship.
  6 17    Generally, statutory provisions and departmental rules
  6 18 regulating milk are based on model legislation referred to
  6 19 as the "Grade 'A' Pasteurized Milk Ordinance" (Code section
  6 20 192.101A).  The "Grade 'A' Pasteurized Milk Ordinance" defines
  6 21 a milk product as including cream, sour cream, dry milk,
  6 22 concentrated milk, eggnog, buttermilk, and yogurt.  All food
  6 23 offered or exposed for sale must be labeled (Code section
  6 24 191.1). All milk must be sold on the basis of grade (Code
  6 25 section 194.10) and only grade "A" pasteurized milk and milk
  6 26 products can be sold to the final consumer (Code section
  6 27 192.103).  Grade "B" milk may be sold for manufacturing
  6 28 purposes (21 IAC 68.2).  All dairy farms selling grade "A" or
  6 29 grade "B" milk must be issued a permit by the department of
  6 30 agriculture and land stewardship (21 IAC 68.2).
  6 31    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that these regulatory
  6 32 provisions do not apply to a person who operates a dairy farm.
  6 33 The person may produce milk and dispose of it or sell it to
  6 34 an individual on a retail basis.  The operator may deliver
  6 35 the milk to a location specified by the individual.  The bill
  7  1 also provides that the regulatory provisions do not apply to
  7  2 the operator of a dairy farm who manufactures a milk product
  7  3 or dairy product, who may dispose of the product or sell it
  7  4 in the same manner as milk originating from the dairy farm.
  7  5 A milk product is defined by the "Grade 'A' Pasteurized Milk
  7  6 Ordinance" and includes cream or yogurt.  A dairy product
  7  7 includes a product other than a milk product whose principal
  7  8 ingredient is milk (e.g., ice cream). The bill provides for
  7  9 the labeling of unpasteurized and ungraded milk, or a product
  7 10 that includes such milk.
  7 11    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  A person who violates the bill's
  7 12 provisions is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
  7 13 189.21).  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
  7 14 no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than
  7 15 $625 or by both.
