The

The
inclusion
of

not
constitute
agreement
with

the
explanation’s

by
the
members
of
the
general

30


This
bill
changes
certain
procedures
relating
to
abandoned
31


structures
and
abatement.
32


The
current
definition
of
“abandoned”
or
“abandonment”
33


requires
a
property
to
have
been
in
violation
for
at
least
six
34


months.
The

element
from

and
states
that
evidence
of
financial
obligations
in
respect
1


to
the
building
does
not
rebut
a
finding
of
abandonment
if
the
2


property
substantially
needs
abatement.
The
bill
requires
a
3


property
to
remain
vacant
for
135
days
before
a
person
may
4


request
the
responsible
building
official
to
inspect
a
building
5


to
determine
whether
it
is
abandoned.
6


The
term
“building”
currently
includes
buildings
and
7


structures
only.
The
bill
adds
mobile
and
manufactured
homes
8


that
have
become
real
property
pursuant
to
Code
section
435.26.
9


The
bill
adds
to
Code
section
657A.1
the
term
“responsible
10


building
official”.
11


Current
law
relies
on
the
current
definition
of
“abandoned”,
12


which
requires
that
a
building
remain
vacant
or
in
violation
13


of
a
housing
or
building
code
for
a
period
of
six
months,
14


to
start
the
clock
for
when
a
person
may
file
a
petition
15


for
abatement
and
includes
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
16


the
building
is
abandoned
or
in
an
unsafe
and
dangerous
17


condition
and
whether
the
building
is
a
public
nuisance.
A
18


petitioner
must
make
service
on
the
owner
in
one
of
three
19


methods.
The
bill
requires
a
property
to
remain
vacant
for
20


at
least
135
days
before
a
person
may
file
a
petition
for
21


abatement.
The
bill
does
not
allow
for
personal
judgments
22


against
any
party,
but
requires
the
petition
to
be
solely
23


against
the
interested
persons’
interest
in
the
property.
The
24


bill
includes
additional
methods
of
service.
The
bill
removes
25


the
application
for
an
injunction
and
the
subsequent
hearing.
26


The
bill
allows
the
responsible
building
official
to
provide
27


findings
for
evidence
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
motion
in
a
28


proceeding
under
Code
chapter
657A
under
certain
circumstances.
29


Current
law
allows
only
an
owner
to
collect
reasonable
30


attorney
fees
actually
incurred
from
the
petitioner
if
the
31


court
finds
that
the
building
in
question
is
not
abandoned
32


or
in
an
unsafe
or
dangerous
condition.
The
bill
allows

the

to
require
the
petitioner
to
pay
an
interested

reasonable
attorney

actually

party
did
not
appear
for
an
inspection
pursuant

Code
section

2


Current
law
requires
the
court
to
conduct
a
hearing
at
3


which
the
court
shall
offer
mortgagees
of
record,
lienholders
4


of
record,
or
other
known
interested
persons
in
the
order
of
5


priority
of
interest
in
title
the
opportunity
to
abate
a
public
6


nuisance.
The
bill
removes
this
hearing
and
creates
a
new
7


process
for
interested
persons
to
demonstrate
their
intent
and
8


ability
to
abate
the
nuisance
and
act
as
the
receiver.
If
9


the
building
is
a
historic
building
or
located
in
a
historic
10


district,
the
court
shall
give
preference
to
an
economically
11


feasible
rehabilitation
plan,
other
than
a
plan
proposed
in
12


good
faith
by
the
owner,
that
preserves
the
historical
nature
13


of
the
building.
14


Current
law
allows
a
court
to
empower
a
receiver
to
issue
15


notes
and
secure
the
notes
by
mortgage
bearing
interest
at
16


the
rate
provided
for
judgments
pursuant
to
Code
section
17


535.3
and
terms
and
conditions
approved
by
the
court.
The
18


bill
allows
the
court
to
provide
for
a
higher
interest
rate
19


than
that
provided
in
Code
section
535.3
if
it
meets
certain
20


conditions.
If
the
receiver
contemplates
a
transfer
of
the
21


note
and
mortgage
at
the
time
that
the
receiver
seeks
court
22


authorization
of
the
contemplated
transfer,
the
receiver
shall
23


disclose
to
the
mortgagee
the
contemplated
transfer
in
the
24


receiver’s
application
for
approval
of
the
mortgage.
25


The
bill
makes
the
interested
party
responsible
for
paying
26


the
mortgagee’s
reasonable
costs
and
attorney
fees
when
the
27


interested
party
pays
off
the
receiver’s
mortgage
loan.
28


Current
law
does
not
require
the
receiver
to
pay
the
29


reasonable
attorney
fees
for
a
plaintiff
who
requested
an
30


inspection
under
Code
section
567A.1A.
The
bill
makes
the
31


receiver
responsible
for
the
plaintiff’s
reasonable
attorney
32


fees
in
most
situations,
but
creates
scenarios
that
could
make


33


a
neighboring
landowner
who
pursued
the
action
in
bad
faith
34


liable
for
attorney
fees.
