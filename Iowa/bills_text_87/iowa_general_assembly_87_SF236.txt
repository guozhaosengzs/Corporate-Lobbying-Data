 11 21    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
 11 22 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 11 23                           EXPLANATION
 11 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 26    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 11 27    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 11 28 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 11 29 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 11 30 of fireworks.
 11 31    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 11 32 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 11 33 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 11 34 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 11 35 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12  1 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12  2 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12  3 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12  4 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12  5 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12  6 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12  7 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12  8 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12  9 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 10 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 11 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 12    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 13 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 14 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 15 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.
 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt
 13  8 rules to permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell
 13  9 consumer fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between
 13 10 June 1 and July 8 and between December 10 and January 3 each
 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14  4 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14  5 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14  6 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 12 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 13 effective immediately upon filing.
 15 14    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.
 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt
 13  8 rules to permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell
 13  9 consumer fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between
 13 10 June 1 and July 8 and between December 10 and January 3 each
 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14  4 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14  5 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14  6 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency

 11 23                           EXPLANATION
 11 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 26    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 11 27    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 11 28 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 11 29 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 11 30 of fireworks.
 11 31    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 11 32 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 11 33 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 11 34 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 11 35 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12  1 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12  2 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12  3 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12  4 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12  5 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12  6 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12  7 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12  8 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12  9 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 10 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 11 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 12    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 13 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 14 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 15 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.

 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified

 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt

 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's

 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration

 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the

 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the

 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.

 11 35 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12  1 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12  2 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12  3 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12  4 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12  5 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12  6 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12  7 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12  8 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12  9 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 10 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 11 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 12    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 13 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 14 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 15 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.
 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt
 13  8 rules to permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell
 13  9 consumer fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between
 13 10 June 1 and July 8 and between December 10 and January 3 each
 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14  4 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14  5 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14  6 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 12 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 11 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 26    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 11 27    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 11 28 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 11 29 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 11 30 of fireworks.
 11 31    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 11 32 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 11 33 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 11 34 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 11 35 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12  1 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12  2 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12  3 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12  4 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12  5 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12  6 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12  7 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12  8 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12  9 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 10 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 11 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 12    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 13 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 14 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 15 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.
 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt
 13  8 rules to permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell
 13  9 consumer fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between
 13 10 June 1 and July 8 and between December 10 and January 3 each
 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14  4 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14  5 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14  6 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 12 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 13 effective immediately upon filing.
 15 14    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 21    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
 11 22 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 11 23                           EXPLANATION
 11 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 26    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 11 27    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 11 28 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 11 29 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 11 30 of fireworks.
 11 31    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 11 32 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 11 33 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 11 34 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 11 35 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12  1 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12  2 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12  3 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12  4 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12  5 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12  6 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12  7 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12  8 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12  9 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 10 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 11 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 12    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 13 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 14 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 15 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.
 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt
 13  8 rules to permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell
 13  9 consumer fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between
 13 10 June 1 and July 8 and between December 10 and January 3 each
 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14  4 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14  5 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14  6 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 12 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 13 effective immediately upon filing.
 15 14    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 28 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 11 29 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 11 30 of fireworks.
 11 31    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 11 32 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 11 33 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 11 34 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 11 35 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12  1 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12  2 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12  3 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12  4 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12  5 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12  6 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12  7 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12  8 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12  9 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 10 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 11 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 12    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 13 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 14 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 15 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.
 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt
 13  8 rules to permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell
 13  9 consumer fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between
 13 10 June 1 and July 8 and between December 10 and January 3 each
 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14  4 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14  5 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14  6 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 12 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 13 effective immediately upon filing.
 15 14    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class

 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that

 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt

 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for

 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or

 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple

 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 12 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 13 effective immediately upon filing.

 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.

 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each

 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the

 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the

 11 32 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 11 33 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 11 34 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 11 35 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12  1 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12  2 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12  3 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12  4 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12  5 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12  6 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12  7 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,

 12  9 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 10 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 11 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 12    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 13 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 14 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 15 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 16    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 17 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 18 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 19 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 20 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 21 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 22 a $1,000 annual licensing fee for a retailer at a permanent
 12 23 building who devotes 50 percent or more of the retailer's
 12 24 retail floor space to the sale or display of first=class
 12 25 consumer fireworks, and a $500 annual licensing fee for a
 12 26 retailer at a temporary structure who devotes 50 percent or
 12 27 more the retailer's retail floor space to the sale or display
 12 28 of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers who devote less
 12 29 than 50 percent of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 30 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks are required
 12 31 to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. A community group
 12 32 that sells first=class consumer fireworks is required to pay
 12 33 an annual licensing fee of $400. The bill requires an annual
 12 34 licensing fee of $100 for retailers or community groups that
 12 35 sell only second=class consumer fireworks.
 13  1 The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13  2 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13  3 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13  4 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers
 13  5 and community groups provide proof of and maintain commercial
 13  6 general liability insurance with specified coverage amounts.
 13  7 Under the bill, the state fire marshal is required to adopt
 13  8 rules to permit licensed retailers and community groups to sell
 13  9 consumer fireworks at conforming permanent buildings between
 13 10 June 1 and July 8 and between December 10 and January 3 each
 13 11 year and at conforming temporary structures from June 13 to
 13 12 July 8 each year.
 13 13    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 14 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 15 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 16 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 17 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 18 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 19 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 20 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 21 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 22 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 23 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 24 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 25    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 26 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 27 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 28 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 13 29 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 13 30 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 13 31 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 13 32 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 13 33    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 13 34 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 13 35 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  1 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  2 than $625, or by both.
 14  3    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or

 14  6 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14  7 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14  8 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14  9 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 10 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 11 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 12 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 13    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 14 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 15 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 16 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 17 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 18 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 19 of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors may
 14 21 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the
 14 22 use of consumer fireworks or display fireworks if the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety or
 14 24 a nuisance. The bill also provides that a city council may
 14 25 adopt an ordinance or resolution to prohibit or limit the use
 14 26 of consumer fireworks, display fireworks, or novelties if the
 14 27 use of such devices would constitute a threat to public safety
 14 28 or a nuisance to landowners. The bill provides that a person
 14 29 who uses fireworks when the use is prohibited or limited by an
 14 30 ordinance in the city or county in which the devices are used
 14 31 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 14 32 $250.
 14 33    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 14 34 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use
 14 35 or explosion of consumer fireworks on days other than June
 15  1 1 through July 8 and December 10 through January 3 of each
 15  2 year. The bill prohibits the use or explosion of consumer
 15  3 fireworks at a time other than between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
 15  4 and 10:00 p.m. of those days, except as specified in the
 15  5 bill. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 15  6 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 15  7 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 15  8 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15  9 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 10 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 11    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 12 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
