  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 research tax credit.
  1  3    1.  a.  The taxes imposed under this division, less the
  1  4 credits allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by a
  1  5 regenerative medicine research tax credit.
  1  6    b.  The credit shall be in an amount equal to sixty percent
  1  7 of a taxpayer's charitable contribution to an eligible research
  1  8 institution located in the state.  A charitable contribution
  1  9 shall not be eligible for the tax credit to the extent the
  1 10 contribution was taken as a deduction pursuant to section 170
  1 11 of the Internal Revenue Code for state tax purposes.  For
  1 12 purposes of this section, "eligible research institution"
  1 13 means an organization qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of
  1 14 the Internal Revenue Code as an organization exempt from
  1 15 federal income tax under section 501(a) of the Internal
  1 16 Revenue Code that is engaged in research designed to improve
  1 17 patient care through the development and dissemination of novel
  1 18 clinical therapies for the functional repair and replacement
  1 19 of diseased tissues and organs, including research for the
  1 20 treatment of cancer. "Eligible research institution" excludes
  1 21 a postsecondary institution or an entity or organization
  1 22 receiving twenty=five percent or more of its annual budget from
  1 23 a postsecondary institution.
  1 24    c.  An individual may claim the tax credit allowed a
  1 25 partnership, limited liability company, S corporation, estate,
  1 26 or trust electing to have the income taxed directly to the
  1 27 individual.  The amount claimed by the individual shall be
  1 28 based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings of
  1 29 the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  1 30 estate, or trust.
  1 31    d.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability
  1 32 is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may be
  1 33 credited to the tax liability for the following four tax years
  1 34 or until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  1 35    2.  a.  A taxpayer must submit an application to the
  2  1 department on or after the date the charitable contribution is
  2  2 made.  The application must be approved by the department in
  2  3 order to claim the tax credit.
  2  4    b.  The department shall accept and approve applications
  2  5 on a first=come, first=served basis according to the date
  2  6 the application was received until the maximum amount of tax
  2  7 credits that may be approved under subsection 3 is reached.
  2  8 If for a fiscal year the aggregate amount of tax credits
  2  9 applied for exceeds the amount specified in subsection 3,
  2 10 the department shall establish a wait list for tax credits.
  2 11 Valid applications filed by the taxpayer but not approved by
  2 12 the department shall be placed on a wait list in the order
  2 13 the applications were received and those applicants shall
  2 14 be given priority for having their applications approved
  2 15 in succeeding years.  Placement on a wait list pursuant to
  2 16 this paragraph shall not constitute a promise binding the
  2 17 state.  The availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  2 18 credit application pursuant to this section in a future year
  2 19 is contingent upon the availability of tax credits in that
  2 20 particular year.
  2 21    c.  For tax credit applications received and approved by
  2 22 the department in the fiscal year during which the charitable
  2 23 contribution is made, the tax credit shall be claimed for the
  2 24 tax year during which the charitable contribution is made.  For
  2 25 tax credit applications approved in any fiscal year following
  2 26 the fiscal year during which the charitable contribution is
  2 27 made, the tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during

  2 29 credit shall not be carried back to a tax year prior to the tax
  2 30 year in which the taxpayer claims the tax credit.

  4  7 qualified under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and must
  4  8 engage in research that is designed to improve patient care
  4  9 through the development and dissemination of novel clinical

  4 26 four years.  The tax credit cannot be carried back to a prior
  4 27 tax year.  For tax credit applications received and approved by
  4 28 the department in the fiscal year during which the charitable
  4 29 contribution is made, the tax credit shall be claimed for the
  4 30 tax year during which the charitable contribution is made.  For
  4 31 applications approved by the department in any later fiscal
  4 32 year, the tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during
  4 33 which the application is approved.
  4 34    The bill applies retroactively to January 1, 2017, for
