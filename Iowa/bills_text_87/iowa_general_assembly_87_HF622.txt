  8 32    Sec. 10.  APPLICABILITY.  The following provision or
  8 33 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after
  8 34 January 1, 2018:
  8 35    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  9  1 subsection 41.
  9  2    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.9,
  9  3 subsection 2, paragraph "k".
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,

  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date

 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 32    Sec. 10.  APPLICABILITY.  The following provision or
  8 33 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to

 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double

 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account

 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder

 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously

 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal

 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment

 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the

 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are

 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal

 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.

 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment

 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal

 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 35    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  9  1 subsection 41.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The

 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000

 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account

 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred

 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred

 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar

 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal

  8 33 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after
  8 34 January 1, 2018:
  8 35    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  9  1 subsection 41.
  9  2    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.9,
  9  3 subsection 2, paragraph "k".
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.

 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  8 33 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable

 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  8 34 January 1, 2018:
  8 35    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  9  1 subsection 41.
  9  2    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.9,
  9  3 subsection 2, paragraph "k".
  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.
 12  4    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 12  5 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one

  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is

  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to

 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal

 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account

 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss

 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred

 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are

 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9 14 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents
  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax

 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement

 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9  8 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  9 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9 10 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9 11 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9 12 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9 13 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time

  9 15 who do not own a single=family or multifamily residence and
  9 16 who have not owned or purchased a single=family or multifamily
  9 17 residence for at least three years prior to the date the
  9 18 individual is named as a designated beneficiary, and the date
  9 19 of the home purchase for which the account's funds are applied.
  9 20 "Single=family residence" is also defined in the bill.  The
  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the

 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible

 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

  9 21 account may be established individually, or jointly with a
  9 22 spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income tax
  9 23 return.
  9 24    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 25 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 26 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 27 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 28 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 29 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of

 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement

 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment

  9 30 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 31 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 32 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 33 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 34 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 35 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
 10  1 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
 10  2 a first=time homebuyer.
 10  3    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
 10  4 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
 10  5 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
 10  6 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
 10  7 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10 15 issued for the account.
 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 12  3 purposes.

 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for

 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other

 10  8 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  9 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10 10 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10 11 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10 12 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10 13 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10 14 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement

 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 19 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other
 11 32 order, including an order in bankruptcy following a filing for
 11 33 protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 34    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 35 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 12  1 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 12  2 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax

 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was

 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered

 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar

 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 25 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 26 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 27 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 28 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 29 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 30 withdrawal was made by reason of the death of the account
 11 31 holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy, or other

 10 16    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10 17 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 18 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect

 10 20 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 21 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified

 10 21 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 22    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 23 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 24 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 25 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 26 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 27 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 28 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 29 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 30 received from the account holder's accounts.  The total amount
 10 31 that may be deducted or excluded from the individual income
 10 32 tax for these two tax incentives cannot exceed an aggregate
 10 33 lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum deduction determined
 10 34 above for the applicable year ($20,000 for 2016), or double
 10 35 that amount for married taxpayers with a joint account ($40,000
 11  1 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to claim the tax
 11  2 incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year the account
 11  3 holder first opened an account, or on the date when account
 11  4 funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 11  5 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 11  6 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 11  7 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 11  8 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined
 11  9 in the bill, and "qualified home purchase" requires that the
 11 10 account be open for at least 90 days prior to the purchase.
 11 11 Amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
 11 12 account holder by a person other than the account holder are
 11 13 not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would cause loss
 11 14 of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11 15    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11 16 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11 17 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11 18 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11 19 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 20 a person other than the account holder are not considered

 11 22 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 23 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 24 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
