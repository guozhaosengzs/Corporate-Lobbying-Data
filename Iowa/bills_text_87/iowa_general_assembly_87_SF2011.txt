  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code
  2 18 chapter 459, the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code
  2 19 chapter 459)  by requiring that a county board of supervisors
  2 20 (board) send a notice to certain landowners that a permit
  2 21 application has been filed with the department of natural
  2 22 resources (DNR) proposing to construct a confinement feeding
  2 23 operation structure (structure) which is part of a proposed or
  2 24 existing confinement feeding operation sometimes referred to
  2 25 as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).  The notice
  2 26 must be sent by certified or ordinary mail to each neighbor
  2 27 holding legal title to land located within two miles from the
  2 28 location of the proposed construction site.   An application
  2 29 must include a brief summary of information regarding the
  2 30 proposal, which must at least state: (1) the identity of the
  2 31 applicant, (2) the type and numbers of animals to be confined
  2 32 at the CAFO if each proposed structure were constructed, and
  2 33 (3) the location, type, and size of each structure proposed to
  2 34 be constructed.  The notice must include the summary and may
  2 35 also state time and place of a public hearing regarding the
  3  1 application conducted by the board.  The bill provides that the
  3  2 same information must be included in the notice of a public
  3  3 hearing.
  3  4    BACKGROUND == DNR PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR is required to
  3  5 approve or disapprove a permit to construct (including expand)
  3  6 structures (Code section 459.303). DNR must disapprove an
  3  7 application that does not satisfy the requirements of the Code
  3  8 chapter. A permit is required if after constructing all such
  3  9 structures, a CAFO would have an animal unit capacity of at
  3 10 least 1,000 animal units (AUs) or the proposed structure is an
  3 11 unformed manure storage structure.  A special exemption applies
  3 12 to a CAFO owned by a research college (Code section 459.303).
  3 13 As part of the process, the permit application must be filed
  3 14 with DNR and the board in the county where the construction
  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).
  4 10    BILL'S EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon
  4 11 enactment.

  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  2 17    BILL'S SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code
  2 18 chapter 459, the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code
  2 19 chapter 459)  by requiring that a county board of supervisors
  2 20 (board) send a notice to certain landowners that a permit
  2 21 application has been filed with the department of natural
  2 22 resources (DNR) proposing to construct a confinement feeding
  2 23 operation structure (structure) which is part of a proposed or
  2 24 existing confinement feeding operation sometimes referred to
  2 25 as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).  The notice
  2 26 must be sent by certified or ordinary mail to each neighbor
  2 27 holding legal title to land located within two miles from the
  2 28 location of the proposed construction site.   An application
  2 29 must include a brief summary of information regarding the
  2 30 proposal, which must at least state: (1) the identity of the
  2 31 applicant, (2) the type and numbers of animals to be confined
  2 32 at the CAFO if each proposed structure were constructed, and
  2 33 (3) the location, type, and size of each structure proposed to
  2 34 be constructed.  The notice must include the summary and may
  2 35 also state time and place of a public hearing regarding the
  3  1 application conducted by the board.  The bill provides that the
  3  2 same information must be included in the notice of a public
  3  3 hearing.
  3  4    BACKGROUND == DNR PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR is required to
  3  5 approve or disapprove a permit to construct (including expand)
  3  6 structures (Code section 459.303). DNR must disapprove an
  3  7 application that does not satisfy the requirements of the Code
  3  8 chapter. A permit is required if after constructing all such
  3  9 structures, a CAFO would have an animal unit capacity of at
  3 10 least 1,000 animal units (AUs) or the proposed structure is an
  3 11 unformed manure storage structure.  A special exemption applies
  3 12 to a CAFO owned by a research college (Code section 459.303).
  3 13 As part of the process, the permit application must be filed
  3 14 with DNR and the board in the county where the construction
  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code
  2 18 chapter 459, the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code
  2 19 chapter 459)  by requiring that a county board of supervisors
  2 20 (board) send a notice to certain landowners that a permit
  2 21 application has been filed with the department of natural
  2 22 resources (DNR) proposing to construct a confinement feeding
  2 23 operation structure (structure) which is part of a proposed or
  2 24 existing confinement feeding operation sometimes referred to
  2 25 as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).  The notice
  2 26 must be sent by certified or ordinary mail to each neighbor
  2 27 holding legal title to land located within two miles from the
  2 28 location of the proposed construction site.   An application
  2 29 must include a brief summary of information regarding the
  2 30 proposal, which must at least state: (1) the identity of the
  2 31 applicant, (2) the type and numbers of animals to be confined
  2 32 at the CAFO if each proposed structure were constructed, and
  2 33 (3) the location, type, and size of each structure proposed to
  2 34 be constructed.  The notice must include the summary and may
  2 35 also state time and place of a public hearing regarding the
  3  1 application conducted by the board.  The bill provides that the
  3  2 same information must be included in the notice of a public
  3  3 hearing.
  3  4    BACKGROUND == DNR PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR is required to
  3  5 approve or disapprove a permit to construct (including expand)
  3  6 structures (Code section 459.303). DNR must disapprove an
  3  7 application that does not satisfy the requirements of the Code
  3  8 chapter. A permit is required if after constructing all such
  3  9 structures, a CAFO would have an animal unit capacity of at
  3 10 least 1,000 animal units (AUs) or the proposed structure is an
  3 11 unformed manure storage structure.  A special exemption applies
  3 12 to a CAFO owned by a research college (Code section 459.303).
  3 13 As part of the process, the permit application must be filed
  3 14 with DNR and the board in the county where the construction
  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code
  2 18 chapter 459, the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code
  2 19 chapter 459)  by requiring that a county board of supervisors
  2 20 (board) send a notice to certain landowners that a permit
  2 21 application has been filed with the department of natural
  2 22 resources (DNR) proposing to construct a confinement feeding
  2 23 operation structure (structure) which is part of a proposed or
  2 24 existing confinement feeding operation sometimes referred to
  2 25 as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).  The notice
  2 26 must be sent by certified or ordinary mail to each neighbor
  2 27 holding legal title to land located within two miles from the
  2 28 location of the proposed construction site.   An application
  2 29 must include a brief summary of information regarding the
  2 30 proposal, which must at least state: (1) the identity of the
  2 31 applicant, (2) the type and numbers of animals to be confined
  2 32 at the CAFO if each proposed structure were constructed, and
  2 33 (3) the location, type, and size of each structure proposed to
  2 34 be constructed.  The notice must include the summary and may
  2 35 also state time and place of a public hearing regarding the
  3  1 application conducted by the board.  The bill provides that the
  3  2 same information must be included in the notice of a public
  3  3 hearing.
  3  4    BACKGROUND == DNR PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR is required to
  3  5 approve or disapprove a permit to construct (including expand)
  3  6 structures (Code section 459.303). DNR must disapprove an
  3  7 application that does not satisfy the requirements of the Code
  3  8 chapter. A permit is required if after constructing all such
  3  9 structures, a CAFO would have an animal unit capacity of at
  3 10 least 1,000 animal units (AUs) or the proposed structure is an
  3 11 unformed manure storage structure.  A special exemption applies
  3 12 to a CAFO owned by a research college (Code section 459.303).
  3 13 As part of the process, the permit application must be filed
  3 14 with DNR and the board in the county where the construction
  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  3  4    BACKGROUND == DNR PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR is required to
  3  5 approve or disapprove a permit to construct (including expand)
  3  6 structures (Code section 459.303). DNR must disapprove an
  3  7 application that does not satisfy the requirements of the Code
  3  8 chapter. A permit is required if after constructing all such
  3  9 structures, a CAFO would have an animal unit capacity of at
  3 10 least 1,000 animal units (AUs) or the proposed structure is an
  3 11 unformed manure storage structure.  A special exemption applies
  3 12 to a CAFO owned by a research college (Code section 459.303).
  3 13 As part of the process, the permit application must be filed
  3 14 with DNR and the board in the county where the construction
  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  3  6 structures (Code section 459.303). DNR must disapprove an
  3  7 application that does not satisfy the requirements of the Code
  3  8 chapter. A permit is required if after constructing all such
  3  9 structures, a CAFO would have an animal unit capacity of at
  3 10 least 1,000 animal units (AUs) or the proposed structure is an
  3 11 unformed manure storage structure.  A special exemption applies
  3 12 to a CAFO owned by a research college (Code section 459.303).
  3 13 As part of the process, the permit application must be filed
  3 14 with DNR and the board in the county where the construction
  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  3  4    BACKGROUND == DNR PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR is required to
  3  5 approve or disapprove a permit to construct (including expand)
  3  6 structures (Code section 459.303). DNR must disapprove an
  3  7 application that does not satisfy the requirements of the Code
  3  8 chapter. A permit is required if after constructing all such
  3  9 structures, a CAFO would have an animal unit capacity of at
  3 10 least 1,000 animal units (AUs) or the proposed structure is an
  3 11 unformed manure storage structure.  A special exemption applies
  3 12 to a CAFO owned by a research college (Code section 459.303).
  3 13 As part of the process, the permit application must be filed
  3 14 with DNR and the board in the county where the construction
  3 15 is to occur.  The board may hold a public hearing to receive
  3 16 public comments regarding the application and forward its
  3 17 comments and public comments to DNR prior to the agency's
  3 18 decision to approve or disapprove the application.   The board
  3 19 is required to publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing
  3 20 in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county.  The
  3 21 notice must provide relevant information about the applicant,
  3 22 the proposed construction, and the time and place of the public
  3 23 hearing.
  3 24    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  Code chapter 459 includes a number
  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The

  3 25 of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal feeding
  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each
  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).

  3 26 operation refers to any area in which animals are confined and
  3 27 fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  3 28 A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation that includes a
  3 29 totally roofed building where confined animals are maintained
  3 30 (as compared to an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited
  3 31 to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish.
  3 32 A CAFO's structure includes a building, egg washwater storage
  3 33 structure, or one of two types of manure storage structures,
  3 34 formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls and a
  3 35 floor all constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  4  1 (as compared to an unformed structure such as an earthen
  4  2 impoundment).  A CAFO's size is determined by calculating its
  4  3 AU capacity.   A special equivalency factor is assigned for
  4  4 each classification of confined animal.  For example, each

  4  5 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an
  4  6 equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  The
  4  7 permit requirement threshold of 1,000 AUs means that a permit
  4  8 would be required if after construction the CAFO would have an
  4  9 AU capacity of 2,500 of such swine (1,000 ? 0.4 = 2,500).
