  4 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 19    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions in Code chapter 490
  4 20 ("Iowa Business Corporation Act"), that became effective on
  4 21 March 23, 2011, and created a special requirement governing the
  4 22 terms of office for a public corporation's board of directors
  4 23 (board), unless the board elected to opt out of the requirement
  4 24 by a date certain.  See 2011 Iowa Acts, chapter 2, and Code
  4 25 section 490.806A, which in part superseded Code sections
  4 26 490.805 and 490.806.
  4 27    STAGGERED TERMS FOR DIRECTORS.  The 2011 Act required the
  4 28 public corporation to divide its directors into three equal
  4 29 groups (referred to as "classes"). The directors are then
  4 30 required to serve staggered three=year terms. The board was
  4 31 required to amend its articles of incorporation (articles)
  4 32 in order to comply with the special requirement.  The bill
  4 33 provides that beginning January 1, 2019, the shareholders
  4 34 of the public corporation will elect all directors whose
  4 35 three=year terms are expiring for one=year terms, unless the
  5  1 corporation has adopted the ordinary staggered term method
  5  2 under Code section 490.806.
  5  3    REPEAL.  On January 1, 2022, the bill eliminates a majority
  5  4 of the provisions that allowed for the special requirement and
  5  5 effectively restores the provisions in Code chapter 490 as
  5  6 they existed prior to the 2011 Act.  The one provision that
  5  7 will survive defines a public corporation.  The provision
  5  8 prior to the 2011 Act referenced the national association of
  5  9 securities dealers (NASD) which is no longer in existence. The
  5 10 bill provides that the articles of incorporation survives the
  5 11 repeals of the relevant Code sections.
  5 12    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The provisions of the bill take effect July
  5 13 1, 2018, except for the provision allowing directors to serve
  5 14 one=year terms, which takes effect January 1, 2019.
