  3 19                           EXPLANATION
  3 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 22    Current law authorizes but does not require the board of
  3 23 township trustees to provide emergency medical service for
  3 24 the township and to fund such service through imposition of
  3 25 a property tax levy. This bill establishes a process for
  3 26 voter approval of a proposition to require a board of township
  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own
  3 32 motion, and upon receipt of a valid petition shall, direct the
  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a
  4  3 city and outside those areas being provided emergency medical
  4  4 service under Code chapter 357F (benefited emergency medical
  4  5 services district) or 357J (emergency response district) for a
  4  6 period of time stated in the proposition not to exceed 10 years
  4  7 but not less than four years.
  4  8    A valid petition must be signed by eligible electors of
  4  9 the township residing outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 10 equal in number to at least 25 percent of the number of votes
  4 11 cast in the township outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 12 for the office of president of the United States or governor
  4 13 at the preceding general election. The election to vote on
  4 14 the proposition is required to be held at the next general
  4 15 election following adoption of the board's motion or receipt of
  4 16 the valid petition, subject to a filing deadline specified in
  4 17 the bill. The bill also specifies the process for filing and
  4 18 hearing objections to the petition and the form of the question
  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition
  4 22 is approved at election, the township trustees are required
  4 23 to provide emergency medical service to those specified areas
  4 24 of the township using methods and funding authorized in Code
  4 25 sections 359.42 and 359.43 for the period of time approved
  4 26 at election, beginning with the fiscal year beginning July 1
  4 27 following the general election at which the proposition was
  4 28 approved.
  4 29    An extension of the period of time for requiring the township
  4 30 to provide emergency medical service under this Code section
  4 31 may be completed using the same procedure as is required for
  4 32 initial approval.

  3 19                           EXPLANATION
  3 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 22    Current law authorizes but does not require the board of
  3 23 township trustees to provide emergency medical service for
  3 24 the township and to fund such service through imposition of
  3 25 a property tax levy. This bill establishes a process for
  3 26 voter approval of a proposition to require a board of township
  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own
  3 32 motion, and upon receipt of a valid petition shall, direct the
  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a
  4  3 city and outside those areas being provided emergency medical
  4  4 service under Code chapter 357F (benefited emergency medical
  4  5 services district) or 357J (emergency response district) for a
  4  6 period of time stated in the proposition not to exceed 10 years
  4  7 but not less than four years.
  4  8    A valid petition must be signed by eligible electors of
  4  9 the township residing outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 10 equal in number to at least 25 percent of the number of votes
  4 11 cast in the township outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 12 for the office of president of the United States or governor
  4 13 at the preceding general election. The election to vote on
  4 14 the proposition is required to be held at the next general
  4 15 election following adoption of the board's motion or receipt of
  4 16 the valid petition, subject to a filing deadline specified in
  4 17 the bill. The bill also specifies the process for filing and
  4 18 hearing objections to the petition and the form of the question
  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition
  4 22 is approved at election, the township trustees are required
  4 23 to provide emergency medical service to those specified areas
  4 24 of the township using methods and funding authorized in Code
  4 25 sections 359.42 and 359.43 for the period of time approved
  4 26 at election, beginning with the fiscal year beginning July 1
  4 27 following the general election at which the proposition was
  4 28 approved.
  4 29    An extension of the period of time for requiring the township
  4 30 to provide emergency medical service under this Code section
  4 31 may be completed using the same procedure as is required for
  4 32 initial approval.

  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition

  3 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 22    Current law authorizes but does not require the board of
  3 23 township trustees to provide emergency medical service for
  3 24 the township and to fund such service through imposition of
  3 25 a property tax levy. This bill establishes a process for
  3 26 voter approval of a proposition to require a board of township
  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own
  3 32 motion, and upon receipt of a valid petition shall, direct the
  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a
  4  3 city and outside those areas being provided emergency medical
  4  4 service under Code chapter 357F (benefited emergency medical
  4  5 services district) or 357J (emergency response district) for a
  4  6 period of time stated in the proposition not to exceed 10 years
  4  7 but not less than four years.
  4  8    A valid petition must be signed by eligible electors of
  4  9 the township residing outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 10 equal in number to at least 25 percent of the number of votes
  4 11 cast in the township outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 12 for the office of president of the United States or governor
  4 13 at the preceding general election. The election to vote on
  4 14 the proposition is required to be held at the next general
  4 15 election following adoption of the board's motion or receipt of
  4 16 the valid petition, subject to a filing deadline specified in
  4 17 the bill. The bill also specifies the process for filing and
  4 18 hearing objections to the petition and the form of the question
  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition
  4 22 is approved at election, the township trustees are required
  4 23 to provide emergency medical service to those specified areas
  4 24 of the township using methods and funding authorized in Code
  4 25 sections 359.42 and 359.43 for the period of time approved

  3 22    Current law authorizes but does not require the board of
  3 23 township trustees to provide emergency medical service for
  3 24 the township and to fund such service through imposition of

  3 26 voter approval of a proposition to require a board of township
  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own
  3 32 motion, and upon receipt of a valid petition shall, direct the
  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a
  4  3 city and outside those areas being provided emergency medical
  4  4 service under Code chapter 357F (benefited emergency medical
  4  5 services district) or 357J (emergency response district) for a

  4  7 but not less than four years.
  4  8    A valid petition must be signed by eligible electors of
  4  9 the township residing outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 10 equal in number to at least 25 percent of the number of votes
  4 11 cast in the township outside the corporate limits of a city

  4 15 election following adoption of the board's motion or receipt of
  4 16 the valid petition, subject to a filing deadline specified in
  4 17 the bill. The bill also specifies the process for filing and
  4 18 hearing objections to the petition and the form of the question
  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition

  3 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 22    Current law authorizes but does not require the board of
  3 23 township trustees to provide emergency medical service for
  3 24 the township and to fund such service through imposition of
  3 25 a property tax levy. This bill establishes a process for
  3 26 voter approval of a proposition to require a board of township
  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own
  3 32 motion, and upon receipt of a valid petition shall, direct the
  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a
  4  3 city and outside those areas being provided emergency medical
  4  4 service under Code chapter 357F (benefited emergency medical
  4  5 services district) or 357J (emergency response district) for a
  4  6 period of time stated in the proposition not to exceed 10 years
  4  7 but not less than four years.
  4  8    A valid petition must be signed by eligible electors of
  4  9 the township residing outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 10 equal in number to at least 25 percent of the number of votes
  4 11 cast in the township outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 12 for the office of president of the United States or governor
  4 13 at the preceding general election. The election to vote on
  4 14 the proposition is required to be held at the next general
  4 15 election following adoption of the board's motion or receipt of
  4 16 the valid petition, subject to a filing deadline specified in
  4 17 the bill. The bill also specifies the process for filing and
  4 18 hearing objections to the petition and the form of the question
  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition
  4 22 is approved at election, the township trustees are required
  4 23 to provide emergency medical service to those specified areas
  4 24 of the township using methods and funding authorized in Code

  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own

  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a

  3 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 22    Current law authorizes but does not require the board of
  3 23 township trustees to provide emergency medical service for
  3 24 the township and to fund such service through imposition of
  3 25 a property tax levy. This bill establishes a process for
  3 26 voter approval of a proposition to require a board of township
  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own
  3 32 motion, and upon receipt of a valid petition shall, direct the
  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a
  4  3 city and outside those areas being provided emergency medical
  4  4 service under Code chapter 357F (benefited emergency medical
  4  5 services district) or 357J (emergency response district) for a
  4  6 period of time stated in the proposition not to exceed 10 years
  4  7 but not less than four years.
  4  8    A valid petition must be signed by eligible electors of
  4  9 the township residing outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 10 equal in number to at least 25 percent of the number of votes
  4 11 cast in the township outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 12 for the office of president of the United States or governor
  4 13 at the preceding general election. The election to vote on
  4 14 the proposition is required to be held at the next general
  4 15 election following adoption of the board's motion or receipt of
  4 16 the valid petition, subject to a filing deadline specified in
  4 17 the bill. The bill also specifies the process for filing and
  4 18 hearing objections to the petition and the form of the question
  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition
  4 22 is approved at election, the township trustees are required

  3 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 22    Current law authorizes but does not require the board of
  3 23 township trustees to provide emergency medical service for
  3 24 the township and to fund such service through imposition of
  3 25 a property tax levy. This bill establishes a process for
  3 26 voter approval of a proposition to require a board of township
  3 27 trustees to provide emergency medical service to specified
  3 28 areas of the township.
  3 29    The bill provides that unless the county is providing
  3 30 emergency medical service to a township pursuant to Code
  3 31 section 331.385, the board of township trustees may on its own
  3 32 motion, and upon receipt of a valid petition shall, direct the
  3 33 county commissioner of elections to submit to the registered
  3 34 voters of the township, excluding those areas of the township
  3 35 within corporate boundaries of a city, the proposition of
  4  1 requiring the township to provide emergency medical service to
  4  2 those areas of the township outside the corporate limits of a
  4  3 city and outside those areas being provided emergency medical
  4  4 service under Code chapter 357F (benefited emergency medical
  4  5 services district) or 357J (emergency response district) for a
  4  6 period of time stated in the proposition not to exceed 10 years
  4  7 but not less than four years.

  4  9 the township residing outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 10 equal in number to at least 25 percent of the number of votes
  4 11 cast in the township outside the corporate limits of a city
  4 12 for the office of president of the United States or governor
  4 13 at the preceding general election. The election to vote on

  4 17 the bill. The bill also specifies the process for filing and
  4 18 hearing objections to the petition and the form of the question
  4 19 that appears on the ballot.
  4 20    A proposition is adopted if a majority of those voting on the
  4 21 proposition at the election approves it.  If the proposition
