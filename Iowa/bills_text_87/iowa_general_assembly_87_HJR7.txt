  1 18    In all the cases above enumerated, and, in all other cases,
  1 19 except for laws enacted pursuant to Article XI, section 2,

  1 33    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing proposed
  1 34 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred
  1 35 to the general assembly to be chosen at the next general

  2  5                           EXPLANATION

  2 23 general assembly for adoption before being submitted to the
  2 24 electorate for ratification.
