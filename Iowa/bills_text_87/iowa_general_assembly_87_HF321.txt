  1 11    1.  The department of human services shall amend its
  1 12 administrative rules pursuant to chapter 17A to do all of the
  1 13 following:
  1 14    a.  Provide income eligibility for state child care
  1 15 assistance, according to family size for children needing basic
  1 16 care, to families whose nonexempt gross monthly income does not
  1 17 exceed two hundred percent of the federal poverty level.
  1 18    b.  Adjust the state child care assistance copayment schedule
  1 19 in incrementally increased amounts for families whose nonexempt
  1 20 gross monthly income does not exceed two hundred percent of the
  1 21 federal poverty level.
  1 22    2.  The rules adopted pursuant to this section shall take
  1 23 effect January 1, 2018.
  1 24                           EXPLANATION
  1 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 27    This bill relates to state child care assistance, including
  1 28 income eligibility and waiting list guidelines and copayment
  1 29 requirements.
  1 30    The state child care assistance program is administered by
  1 31 the department of human services. Based upon the availability
  1 32 of the funding appropriated for state child care assistance
  1 33 for a fiscal year, the department establishes waiting
  1 34 lists for state child care assistance in descending order
  1 35 of prioritization. Under current law, one of the waiting
  2  1 list requirements relates to families with an income of
  2  2 more than 100 percent but not more than 145 percent of the
  2  3 federal poverty level whose members, for at least 28 hours
  2  4 per week in the aggregate, are employed or are participating
  2  5 at a satisfactory level in an approved training program or
  2  6 educational program.  The bill increases this waiting list
  2  7 income eligibility limit from 145 percent to 200 percent.
  2  8    The bill directs the department of human services to amend
  2  9 its administrative rules to provide income eligibility for
  2 10 state child care assistance, according to family size for
  2 11 children needing basic care, to families whose nonexempt
  2 12 gross monthly income does not exceed 200 percent of the
  2 13 federal poverty level. The bill also directs the department
  2 14 to adjust the state child care assistance copayment schedule
  2 15 in incrementally increased amounts for such families. The
  2 16 administrative rules adopted by the department shall be
  2 17 effective January 1, 2018.
