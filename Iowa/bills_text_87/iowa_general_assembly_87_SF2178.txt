  3  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  4    This bill prohibits a person from establishing, promoting,
  3  5 or operating a pyramid promotional scheme.
  3  6    The bill defines a "pyramid promotional scheme" as a plan
  3  7 or operation by which a person provides consideration for the
  3  8 opportunity to receive compensation primarily derived from
  3  9 introducing other persons into the plan or operation and not
  3 10 from the sale or consumption of goods, services, or property.
  3 11 The bill provides that a "pyramid promotional scheme" includes
  3 12 a plan or operation by which the number of participants is
  3 13 limited either expressly or by the application of conditions
  3 14 affecting eligibility, or a plan or operation by which a
  3 15 person, upon providing consideration, obtains goods, services,
  3 16 or property in addition to the right to receive compensation.
  3 17    The bill provides that it shall not be construed to
  3 18 prohibit a plan or operation, or define a plan or operation
  3 19 as a pyramid promotional scheme, based on the fact that
  3 20 participants give consideration in return for the right to
  3 21 receive compensation based upon purchases by participants for
  3 22 personal use, consumption, or resale, if the plan or operation
  3 23 does not result in inventory loading and implements a bona fide
  3 24 inventory repurchase program as defined in the bill.
  3 25    A violation of the bill constitutes an unlawful practice
  3 26 under both the "Iowa Consumer Frauds Act" (Code section 714.16)
  3 27 and the "Private Right of Action For the Iowa Consumer Frauds
  3 28 Act" (Code chapter 714H).  Under the "Iowa Consumer Frauds
  3 29 Act", the attorney general may investigate, issue subpoenas,
  3 30 and commence civil proceedings seeking restraining orders or
  3 31 injunctions prohibiting persons from engaging in unlawful
  3 32 practices or seeking termination of the business affairs of a
  3 33 person engaging in unlawful practices. In addition, a civil
  3 34 penalty of up to $40,000 per violation may be imposed by a
  3 35 court against a person found to have committed an unlawful
  4  1 practice. Under the "Private Right of Action For the Iowa
  4  2 Consumer Frauds Act", a consumer may sue to recover actual
  4  3 damages and may seek punitive damages up to three times the
  4  4 actual damages in cases of willful and wanton conduct by a
  4  5 defendant. In addition, if the consumer prevails in a private
  4  6 right of action lawsuit, the court must award reasonable
  4  7 attorney fees.
