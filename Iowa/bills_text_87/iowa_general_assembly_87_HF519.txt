  4 31    2.  a.  A person who has been required to participate in the
  4 32 program by a court or governmental entity and whose driver's
  4 33 license is suspended or revoked shall not begin participation

  5 15 shall include an itemization of all costs associated with
  5 16 participation in the program.
  5 17    3.  The program shall be evidence=based and shall satisfy at
  5 18 least two of the following requirements:

  6 13 testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  6 14    (b)  The participant's employment requires the participant's

  6 18 requirements of the program while submitting to testing twice
  6 19 per day and poses a substantial risk of continuing to violate
  6 20 the requirements of the program.
  6 21    5.  A jurisdiction wishing to participate in the program
  6 22 shall submit an application to the department. A jurisdiction
  6 23 shall not participate in the program unless the jurisdiction's

  7 10 with defined objectives and timelines shall be initiated, and
  7 11 measurements of the effectiveness and impact of the proposed
  7 12 alteration or modification to a core component shall be
  7 13 monitored. The data shall be assessed and the department
  7 14 shall make a determination as to whether the stated goals of
  7 15 the alteration or modification were achieved and whether the
  7 16 alteration or modification should be formally implemented into
  7 17 the program.

 15  3                           EXPLANATION
 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 14 19 a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and drug
 14 20 monitoring program established pursuant to chapter 901D if the
 14 21 person's offense under this chapter qualifies as an eligible
 14 22 offense as defined in section 901D.2, and the person's offense
 14 23 occurred in a participating jurisdiction, as defined in section
 14 24 901D.2. The department, in consultation with the department
 14 25 of public safety, may adopt rules for issuing and accepting a
 14 26 certification of participation in and compliance with a program
 14 27 established pursuant to chapter 901D.  This subsection shall be
 14 28 construed and implemented to comply with 23 U.S.C. {164(a), as
 14 29 amended by the federal Fixing America's Surface Transportation
 14 30 Act, Pub. L. No. 114=94, {1414, and shall not apply if such

 15  3                           EXPLANATION
 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 14 21 person's offense under this chapter qualifies as an eligible
 14 22 offense as defined in section 901D.2, and the person's offense
 14 23 occurred in a participating jurisdiction, as defined in section
 14 24 901D.2. The department, in consultation with the department
 14 25 of public safety, may adopt rules for issuing and accepting a

 15  3                           EXPLANATION
 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  3                           EXPLANATION
 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 14 21 person's offense under this chapter qualifies as an eligible
 14 22 offense as defined in section 901D.2, and the person's offense
 14 23 occurred in a participating jurisdiction, as defined in section
 14 24 901D.2. The department, in consultation with the department
 14 25 of public safety, may adopt rules for issuing and accepting a
 14 26 certification of participation in and compliance with a program
 14 27 established pursuant to chapter 901D.  This subsection shall be
 14 28 construed and implemented to comply with 23 U.S.C. {164(a), as
 14 29 amended by the federal Fixing America's Surface Transportation
 14 30 Act, Pub. L. No. 114=94, {1414, and shall not apply if such
 14 31 application results in a finding of noncompliance with 23
 14 32 U.S.C. {164 that results or will result in a reservation
 14 33 or transfer of funds pursuant to 23 U.S.C. {164(b). This

 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,

 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years

 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  3                           EXPLANATION
 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for

 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for

 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.

 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee

 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the

 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's

 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND

 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which

 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  3                           EXPLANATION
 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code

 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement

 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  3                           EXPLANATION
 15  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years

 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a

 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,

 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor

 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a

 15  6    DIVISION I ==== HOMICIDE BY VEHICLE ==== USE OF ELECTRONIC
 15  7 COMMUNICATION DEVICES WHILE DRIVING.  Current law provides
 15  8 that a person commits a class "C" felony when the person
 15  9 unintentionally causes the death of another person by driving
 15 10 a motor vehicle in a reckless manner with willful or wanton
 15 11 disregard for the safety of persons or property. A class "C"
 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,
 15 30 and portable or mobile computers. An electronic message is
 15 31 a self=contained piece of digital communication designed or
 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person

 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per

 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15 12 felony is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a

 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

       ns/nh
 15 13 and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 15 14    This bill provides that for the purposes of that provision,
 15 15 a person's hand=held use of an electronic communication device
 15 16 while driving a motor vehicle shall be considered prima facie
 15 17 evidence that the person was driving the motor vehicle in a
 15 18 reckless manner with willful or wanton disregard for the safety
 15 19 of persons or property. This provision does not apply to a
 15 20 member of a public safety agency performing official duties
 15 21 and acting in a reasonable manner, a health care professional
 15 22 or emergency medical services provider in the course of an
 15 23 emergency situation acting in a reasonable manner, or a person
 15 24 using an electronic communication device in a hands=free or
 15 25 voice=operated mode, including but not limited to the use of
 15 26 a headset.
 15 27    An electronic communication device is a device capable of
 15 28 being used to compose, send, receive, or read an electronic
 15 29 message, and includes telephones, personal digital assistants,

 15 32 intended to be transmitted between electronic communication
 15 33 devices, and includes video calls, electronic mail, text
 15 34 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,

 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not

 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 15 35 an internet site.
 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which

 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.

 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the

 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and

 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the

 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making

 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which

 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the

 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general

 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary

 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making

 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.

 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.

 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of

 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.

 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation

 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16  1 DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE SOBRIETY AND DRUG MONITORING
 16  2 PROGRAM.  The bill directs the department of public safety
 16  3 (DPS) to establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until

 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 16  4 program that is available 24 hours per day, seven days per
 16  5 week. Under the program, a court or governmental entity, as
 16  6 a condition of bond, pretrial release, sentence, probation,
 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.

 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which

 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16  7 parole, or a temporary restricted license, may require a person
 16  8 who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been convicted
 16  9 of an eligible offense to abstain from alcohol and controlled
 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.

 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's
 20 11 offense occurred in a participating jurisdiction.

 16 10 substances for a period of time. The bill provides that an
 16 11 eligible offense is a criminal offense in which the abuse of
 16 12 alcohol or a controlled substance was a contributing factor
 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.

 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 16 13 in the commission of the offense as determined by the court
 16 14 or governmental entity of the participating jurisdiction,
 16 15 including but not limited to a first offense of operating
 16 16 while intoxicated where the person's alcohol concentration
 16 17 exceeded .15 and an accident resulting in personal injury or
 16 18 property damage occurred, and a second or subsequent offense
 16 19 of operating while intoxicated.
 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.
 19 29    DIVISION III ==== OPERATING WHILE INTOXICATED ==== SOBRIETY AND
 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which

 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.

 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code

 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.

 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee

 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.

 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 16 20    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 16 21 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 16 22 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.

 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance

 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
 20  9 drug monitoring program if the person's offense under Code
 20 10 chapter 321J qualifies as an eligible offense and the person's

 16 23 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 16 24 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 16 25 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing

 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the

 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS

 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.

 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate

 16 26    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 16 27 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 16 28 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 16 29 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 16 30 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 16 31 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 16 32 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 16 33 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 16 34 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 16 35 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 17  1 The bill prohibits a person who has been required to
 17  2 participate in the program and whose driver's license is
 17  3 suspended or revoked from participating in the program until
 17  4 the person is eligible for a temporary restricted license. A
 17  5 person must install an ignition interlock device on all motor
 17  6 vehicles owned or operated by the person to participate in
 17  7 the program. A person who has been charged with, pled guilty
 17  8 to, or been convicted of an eligible offense who has not
 17  9 been required to participate in the program may apply to the
 17 10 participating jurisdiction in order to participate.
 17 11    If a jurisdiction applies to and is approved by DPS to
 17 12 participate in the program, the bill requires DPS to assist the
 17 13 jurisdiction in setting up and administering the program. The
 17 14 participating jurisdiction must establish testing locations and
 17 15 may designate a third party to provide testing services.
 17 16    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 17 17 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 17 18 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 17 19 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 17 20 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 17 21 initiated and monitored.
 17 22    The bill requires DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 17 23 and manner of testing; establishing reasonable fees; providing
 17 24 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 17 25 grants, gifts, and donations; establishing a process for
 17 26 the identification and management of indigent participants;
 17 27 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 17 28 group to review and recommend changes to the program; and
 17 29 establishing a process for the submission and approval of
 17 30 applications from jurisdictions. The bill further requires the
 17 31 amount of the fees to be set at an amount such that the fees
 17 32 collected in a participating jurisdiction are sufficient to pay
 17 33 for the costs of the program in the participating jurisdiction,
 17 34 including all costs to the state.
 17 35    In addition, the bill requires DPS to provide for and approve
 18  1 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 18  2 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 18  3 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 18  4 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 18  5 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 18  6 the data management system.
 18  7    A court may condition any bond or pretrial release otherwise
 18  8 authorized by law for a person charged with an eligible offense
 18  9 upon participation in the program and payment of the required
 18 10 fees. A court may also condition a suspended sentence or
 18 11 probation otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted
 18 12 of an eligible offense upon participation in the program
 18 13 and payment of the required fees. Likewise, the board of
 18 14 parole, the department of corrections, or a parole officer
 18 15 may condition parole otherwise authorized by law for a person
 18 16 convicted of an eligible offense upon participation in the
 18 17 program and payment of the required fees.
 18 18    The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 18 19 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 18 20 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 18 21 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 18 22 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 18 23 agency of a participating jurisdiction must enter the
 18 24 participant's information into the data management system. The
 18 25 representative of the agency must provide the participant with
 18 26 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 18 27 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 18 28 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 18 29 participant with information related to the required testing,
 18 30 procedures, and fees.
 18 31    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 18 32 participating jurisdiction must establish and maintain a
 18 33 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 18 34 law enforcement agency must distribute a portion of the fees to
 18 35 any participating third=party designee in accordance with the
 19  1 agreement between the agency and the third=party designee, and
 19  2 the remainder of the fees collected must be deposited in the
 19  3 participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account and must
 19  4 be used only for the purposes of administering and operating
 19  5 the program.
 19  6    The bill requires allegations that a participant failed
 19  7 a test, refused to submit to a test, or failed to appear
 19  8 for testing to be communicated ex parte by the participating
 19  9 jurisdiction, a law enforcement agency of the participating
 19 10 jurisdiction, or the participating jurisdiction's third=party
 19 11 designee to a magistrate as soon as practicable. A magistrate
 19 12 who receives such a communication may order the participant's
 19 13 immediate incarceration pending a hearing on the allegation
 19 14 but lasting no longer than 24 hours after the issuance of the
 19 15 order, or if the participant failed to appear for testing as
 19 16 scheduled, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the arrest of
 19 17 the participant for a violation of the terms of bond, pretrial
 19 18 release, sentence, probation, or parole.
 19 19    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 19 20 test under the program, the court may notify the department
 19 21 of transportation (DOT) of the participant's noncompliance
 19 22 and direct the DOT to withdraw the participant's temporary
 19 23 restricted license and reinstate the remainder of the license
 19 24 suspension or revocation period.
 19 25    The bill requires DPS to submit a report to the general
 19 26 assembly detailing the effectiveness of the program and making
 19 27 recommendations by December 1, 2021. The sobriety and drug
 19 28 monitoring program is repealed July 1, 2022.

 19 30 DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that a
 19 31 temporary restricted license issued under Code chapter 321J
 19 32 (operating while intoxicated) is valid for travel related to
 19 33 participation in a sobriety and drug monitoring program. In
 19 34 addition, the bill requires the DOT to revoke the temporary
 19 35 restricted license of a person operating a motor vehicle
 20  1 while not in compliance with the person's sobriety and drug
 20  2 monitoring program.
 20  3    The bill also provides that in any circumstance in which
 20  4 Code chapter 321J requires the installation of an ignition
 20  5 interlock device in all vehicles owned or operated by a person
 20  6 as a condition of the person's license or privilege to operate
 20  7 noncommercial motor vehicles, the DOT must require the person
 20  8 to be a participant in and in compliance with a sobriety and
