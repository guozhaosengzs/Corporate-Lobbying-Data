  1 21 complete certain housing projects in Iowa.  The total tax
  1 22 incentives issued per fiscal year cannot exceed $20 million,
  1 23 and $5 million of that total cap must be reserved for tax

  1 25 Under current law, the definition of "small city" includes
  1 26 any city or township not located within the 11 most populous
  1 27 counties in the state.  When a city is located in more than one
  1 28 county, it is considered to be located in the county having the

  1 25 Under current law, the definition of "small city" includes
  1 26 any city or township not located within the 11 most populous
  1 27 counties in the state.  When a city is located in more than one
  1 28 county, it is considered to be located in the county having the
