  2  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  6    This bill relates to the possession of contraband in or on
  2  7 the grounds of a community=based correctional facility, and
  2  8 provides penalties.
  2  9    The bill expands the facilities and institutions where a
  2 10 person may commit the criminal offense of possessing contraband
  2 11 to include a community=based correctional facility.
  2 12    "Contraband" is defined under current law to include
  2 13 controlled substances, intoxicating beverages, weapons,
  2 14 explosives, knives or other cutting devices, items that may be
  2 15 fashioned to cause death or injury, and items that may be used
  2 16 to facilitate an escape.
  2 17    A person commits a class "C" felony if the contraband is a
  2 18 weapon, a class "D" felony if the contraband is a controlled
  2 19 substance or intoxicating beverage, and an aggravated
  2 20 misdemeanor if the contraband is an item that may be used to
  2 21 facilitate an escape.  A person also commits an aggravated
  2 22 misdemeanor for failing to report a known violation or
  2 23 attempted violation involving contraband to an official or
  2 24 officer at a community=based correctional facility.
  2 25    The bill, in part, is a response to the Iowa supreme court's
  2 26 decision in State v. Halverson, 857 N.W.2d 632 (Iowa 2015),
  2 27 which held that a person illegally possessing a controlled
  2 28 substance at a community=based correctional facility does not
  2 29 commit the criminal offense of possessing contraband because
  2 30 a community=based correctional facility is not an institution
  2 31 under the control of the department of corrections.
  2 32    A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement for no more
  2 33 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
  2 34 $10,000. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for
  2 35 no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
  3  1 more than $7,500. An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by
  3  2 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
  3  3 $625 but not more than $6,250.
