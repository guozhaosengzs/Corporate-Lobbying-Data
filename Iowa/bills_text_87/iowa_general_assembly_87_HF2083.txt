  1  3    1.  a.  The department shall not approve an application
  1  4 for a permit for the construction, including expansion, of a
  1  5 confinement feeding operation structure under this chapter, if
  1  6 the structure is part of a confinement feeding operation in
  1  7 which swine are kept.
  1  8    b.  A person shall not begin construction, including
  1  9 expansion, of a confinement feeding operation structure under
  1 10 this chapter, if the structure is part of a confinement feeding
  1 11 operation in which swine are kept. However, this paragraph
  1 12 does not apply to a confinement feeding operation which has an
  1 13 animal unit capacity of three hundred or fewer animal units.
  1 14    2.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a person from
  1 15 completing construction, including expansion, of a confinement
  1 16 feeding operation structure, if prior to the effective date
  1 17 of this Act, the person has begun construction, including
  1 18 expansion, of the confinement feeding operation structure as
  1 19 otherwise allowed under this chapter.

  1 22 is requested to establish an interim study committee to

  1 24 in the process of approving or disapproving the construction,
  1 25 including expansion, of confinement feeding operation
  1 26 structures which are part of confinement feeding operations
  1 27 where swine are kept.  The interim study committee shall
  1 28 consider methods to provide for greater decision=making by
  1 29 county boards of supervisors and by the reformation of the
  1 30 master matrix as  provided in section 459.305.  If established,
  1 31 the interim study committee shall submit a report to the
  1 32 general assembly by January 11, 2019, which includes findings
  1 33 and recommendations.
  1 34    Sec. 3.    EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate
  1 35 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2  1                           EXPLANATION
  2  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  4    MORATORIUM.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  2  5 Agriculture Compliance Act") by establishing a moratorium upon
  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings
  2  8 or manure storage structures associated with the confinement
  2  9 feeding operation where swine are kept. The moratorium does
  2 10 not apply to a confinement feeding operation having an animal
  2 11 unit capacity of 300 or fewer animal units.
  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
  2 14 approving an application for a permit to construct a
  2 15 structure, and that a person is prohibited from beginning
  2 16 such construction.  The bill does not prohibit a person from
  2 17 completing construction if, prior to the  effective date of the
  2 18 bill, the person has begun the construction.
  2 19    LEGISLATIVE STUDY.  The bill requests that the legislative
  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase greater public participation in the construction of
  2 22 structures associated with swine production and submit a report
  2 23 to the general assembly by January 11, 2019.
  2 24    BACKGROUND.  The department of natural resources regulates
  2 25 confinement feeding operations. A confinement feeding
  2 26 operation refers to an area in which certain animals associated
  2 27 with agriculture are confined and fed and maintained under a
  2 28 roof for 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes
  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the
  3  1 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained under
  3  2 roof at any one time (Code section 459.102). A permit is
  3  3 required if the confinement feeding operation would have an
  3  4 AUC of 1,000 or more. In calculating AUC, each of various
  3  5 types of animals are assigned a special equivalency factor.
  3  6 For example, a butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3  7 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 animal units (Code
  3  8 section 459.102). A confinement feeding operation proposed to
  3  9 include one or more buildings with a capacity of 2,500 breeding
  3 10 swine would be required to obtain a permit (2,500 x 0.4 = 1,000
  3 11 AUC).  In any case, a proposed confinement feeding operation
  3 12 having 755 such swine would be subject to the bill's moratorium
  3 13 (755 x 0.4 = 302 AUC).
  3 14    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  3 15 that date.

  2  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  4    MORATORIUM.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  2  5 Agriculture Compliance Act") by establishing a moratorium upon
  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings
  2  8 or manure storage structures associated with the confinement
  2  9 feeding operation where swine are kept. The moratorium does
  2 10 not apply to a confinement feeding operation having an animal
  2 11 unit capacity of 300 or fewer animal units.
  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
  2 14 approving an application for a permit to construct a
  2 15 structure, and that a person is prohibited from beginning
  2 16 such construction.  The bill does not prohibit a person from
  2 17 completing construction if, prior to the  effective date of the
  2 18 bill, the person has begun the construction.

  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase greater public participation in the construction of
  2 22 structures associated with swine production and submit a report
  2 23 to the general assembly by January 11, 2019.
  2 24    BACKGROUND.  The department of natural resources regulates
  2 25 confinement feeding operations. A confinement feeding
  2 26 operation refers to an area in which certain animals associated
  2 27 with agriculture are confined and fed and maintained under a
  2 28 roof for 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes
  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the
  3  1 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained under
  3  2 roof at any one time (Code section 459.102). A permit is
  3  3 required if the confinement feeding operation would have an
  3  4 AUC of 1,000 or more. In calculating AUC, each of various
  3  5 types of animals are assigned a special equivalency factor.
  3  6 For example, a butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3  7 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 animal units (Code
  3  8 section 459.102). A confinement feeding operation proposed to
  3  9 include one or more buildings with a capacity of 2,500 breeding
  3 10 swine would be required to obtain a permit (2,500 x 0.4 = 1,000
  3 11 AUC).  In any case, a proposed confinement feeding operation
  3 12 having 755 such swine would be subject to the bill's moratorium
  3 13 (755 x 0.4 = 302 AUC).
  3 14    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  3 15 that date.

  2  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  4    MORATORIUM.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  2  5 Agriculture Compliance Act") by establishing a moratorium upon
  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings
  2  8 or manure storage structures associated with the confinement
  2  9 feeding operation where swine are kept. The moratorium does
  2 10 not apply to a confinement feeding operation having an animal
  2 11 unit capacity of 300 or fewer animal units.
  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
  2 14 approving an application for a permit to construct a
  2 15 structure, and that a person is prohibited from beginning
  2 16 such construction.  The bill does not prohibit a person from
  2 17 completing construction if, prior to the  effective date of the
  2 18 bill, the person has begun the construction.
  2 19    LEGISLATIVE STUDY.  The bill requests that the legislative
  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase greater public participation in the construction of
  2 22 structures associated with swine production and submit a report
  2 23 to the general assembly by January 11, 2019.
  2 24    BACKGROUND.  The department of natural resources regulates
  2 25 confinement feeding operations. A confinement feeding
  2 26 operation refers to an area in which certain animals associated
  2 27 with agriculture are confined and fed and maintained under a
  2 28 roof for 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes
  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the
  3  1 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained under
  3  2 roof at any one time (Code section 459.102). A permit is
  3  3 required if the confinement feeding operation would have an
  3  4 AUC of 1,000 or more. In calculating AUC, each of various
  3  5 types of animals are assigned a special equivalency factor.
  3  6 For example, a butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3  7 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 animal units (Code
  3  8 section 459.102). A confinement feeding operation proposed to
  3  9 include one or more buildings with a capacity of 2,500 breeding
  3 10 swine would be required to obtain a permit (2,500 x 0.4 = 1,000
  3 11 AUC).  In any case, a proposed confinement feeding operation
  3 12 having 755 such swine would be subject to the bill's moratorium
  3 13 (755 x 0.4 = 302 AUC).
  3 14    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon

  1 12 does not apply to a confinement feeding operation which has an
  1 13 animal unit capacity of three hundred or fewer animal units.

  1 15 completing construction, including expansion, of a confinement
  1 16 feeding operation structure, if prior to the effective date
  1 17 of this Act, the person has begun construction, including

  2 28 roof for 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes
  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the

  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the
  3  1 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained under
  3  2 roof at any one time (Code section 459.102). A permit is
  3  3 required if the confinement feeding operation would have an
  3  4 AUC of 1,000 or more. In calculating AUC, each of various
  3  5 types of animals are assigned a special equivalency factor.
  3  6 For example, a butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3  7 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 animal units (Code
  3  8 section 459.102). A confinement feeding operation proposed to
  3  9 include one or more buildings with a capacity of 2,500 breeding
  3 10 swine would be required to obtain a permit (2,500 x 0.4 = 1,000

  2  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  4    MORATORIUM.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  2  5 Agriculture Compliance Act") by establishing a moratorium upon
  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings
  2  8 or manure storage structures associated with the confinement
  2  9 feeding operation where swine are kept. The moratorium does
  2 10 not apply to a confinement feeding operation having an animal
  2 11 unit capacity of 300 or fewer animal units.
  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
  2 14 approving an application for a permit to construct a
  2 15 structure, and that a person is prohibited from beginning
  2 16 such construction.  The bill does not prohibit a person from
  2 17 completing construction if, prior to the  effective date of the
  2 18 bill, the person has begun the construction.
  2 19    LEGISLATIVE STUDY.  The bill requests that the legislative
  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase greater public participation in the construction of
  2 22 structures associated with swine production and submit a report
  2 23 to the general assembly by January 11, 2019.
  2 24    BACKGROUND.  The department of natural resources regulates
  2 25 confinement feeding operations. A confinement feeding
  2 26 operation refers to an area in which certain animals associated
  2 27 with agriculture are confined and fed and maintained under a
  2 28 roof for 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes
  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the
  3  1 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained under
  3  2 roof at any one time (Code section 459.102). A permit is
  3  3 required if the confinement feeding operation would have an
  3  4 AUC of 1,000 or more. In calculating AUC, each of various
  3  5 types of animals are assigned a special equivalency factor.
  3  6 For example, a butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3  7 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 animal units (Code
  3  8 section 459.102). A confinement feeding operation proposed to
  3  9 include one or more buildings with a capacity of 2,500 breeding
  3 10 swine would be required to obtain a permit (2,500 x 0.4 = 1,000
  3 11 AUC).  In any case, a proposed confinement feeding operation
  3 12 having 755 such swine would be subject to the bill's moratorium
  3 13 (755 x 0.4 = 302 AUC).

  2  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  4    MORATORIUM.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the "Animal
  2  5 Agriculture Compliance Act") by establishing a moratorium upon
  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings
  2  8 or manure storage structures associated with the confinement
  2  9 feeding operation where swine are kept. The moratorium does
  2 10 not apply to a confinement feeding operation having an animal
  2 11 unit capacity of 300 or fewer animal units.
  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
  2 14 approving an application for a permit to construct a
  2 15 structure, and that a person is prohibited from beginning
  2 16 such construction.  The bill does not prohibit a person from
  2 17 completing construction if, prior to the  effective date of the
  2 18 bill, the person has begun the construction.

  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase greater public participation in the construction of
  2 22 structures associated with swine production and submit a report
  2 23 to the general assembly by January 11, 2019.
  2 24    BACKGROUND.  The department of natural resources regulates
  2 25 confinement feeding operations. A confinement feeding
  2 26 operation refers to an area in which certain animals associated
  2 27 with agriculture are confined and fed and maintained under a
  2 28 roof for 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes
  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the
  3  1 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained under
  3  2 roof at any one time (Code section 459.102). A permit is
  3  3 required if the confinement feeding operation would have an
  3  4 AUC of 1,000 or more. In calculating AUC, each of various
  3  5 types of animals are assigned a special equivalency factor.
  3  6 For example, a butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3  7 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 animal units (Code
  3  8 section 459.102). A confinement feeding operation proposed to
  3  9 include one or more buildings with a capacity of 2,500 breeding
  3 10 swine would be required to obtain a permit (2,500 x 0.4 = 1,000
  3 11 AUC).  In any case, a proposed confinement feeding operation
  3 12 having 755 such swine would be subject to the bill's moratorium
  3 13 (755 x 0.4 = 302 AUC).

  2 24    BACKGROUND.  The department of natural resources regulates
  2 25 confinement feeding operations. A confinement feeding
  2 26 operation refers to an area in which certain animals associated
  2 27 with agriculture are confined and fed and maintained under a
  2 28 roof for 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes
  2 29 associated structures including buildings and facilities used
  2 30 to store manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure
  2 31 is required if the structure is an unformed manure storage
  2 32 structure (e.g., an anaerobic lagoon or earthen manure storage
  2 33 structure) or the structure is associated with a confinement
  2 34 feeding operation of a certain size based on a calculation
  2 35 of its proposed animal unit capacity (AUC) which equals the
  3  1 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained under
  3  2 roof at any one time (Code section 459.102). A permit is
  3  3 required if the confinement feeding operation would have an
  3  4 AUC of 1,000 or more. In calculating AUC, each of various
  3  5 types of animals are assigned a special equivalency factor.
  3  6 For example, a butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3  7 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 animal units (Code
  3  8 section 459.102). A confinement feeding operation proposed to
  3  9 include one or more buildings with a capacity of 2,500 breeding
  3 10 swine would be required to obtain a permit (2,500 x 0.4 = 1,000
  3 11 AUC).  In any case, a proposed confinement feeding operation
  3 12 having 755 such swine would be subject to the bill's moratorium
  3 13 (755 x 0.4 = 302 AUC).

  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
