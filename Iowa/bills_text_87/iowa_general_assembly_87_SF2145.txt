  1 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 32    Current law provides an exemption from property taxation
  1 33 for dwelling unit property owned and managed by a nonprofit
  1 34 community housing development organization if the organization
  1 35 owns and manages more than 150 dwelling units located in a city
  2  1 with a population of more than 110,000. This bill authorizes
  2  2 the property tax exemption for dwelling unit property if the
  2  3 property is owned, managed, or controlled by a community
  2  4 housing development organization, instead of requiring both
  2  5 ownership and management of the property.  The bill also lowers
  2  6 the city population criteria from 110,000 to 80,000.
  2  7    The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.7. Code
  2  8 section 25B.7 provides that for a property tax credit or
