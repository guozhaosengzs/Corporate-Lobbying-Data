  3 14 such evidence is not readily available, the fair market value
  3 15 prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time
  3 16 described, which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade

  5  1 time periods, failing to pay for the services, labor, materials
  5  2 or equipment provided incident to such home improvement, or
  5  3 diverting the moneys to a use other than for which the moneys

  5  5 business name, address, or telephone number to a consumer; or
  5  6 enters into an unconscionable home improvement contract with
  5  7 a consumer.
  5  8    The bill provides that it shall be evidence of intent,
  5  9 that the person, who is acting as a contractor, has committed
  5 10 home improvement fraud if the person has previously been
  5 11 convicted under this bill or under a similar statute of the
  5 12 United States or of any state or of the District of Columbia
  5 13 within 10 years of entering into the home improvement contract
  5 14 in question or if the person is currently subject to any
  5 15 administrative orders, judgments, or injunctions that relate to
  5 16 home improvements.
  5 17    The bill provides that a person who commits an offense under
  5 18 the bill is, upon conviction, guilty of a class "D" felony if
