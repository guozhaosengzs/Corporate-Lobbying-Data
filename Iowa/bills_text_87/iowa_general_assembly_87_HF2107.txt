  1  1    Section 1.  Section 20.15, Code 2018, is amended by striking
  1  2 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1  3    20.15  Elections.
  1  4    1.  Upon the filing of a petition for certification of an
  1  5 employee organization, the board shall submit a question to
  1  6 the public employees at an election in the bargaining unit
  1  7 found appropriate by the board. The question on the ballot
  1  8 shall permit the public employees to vote for no bargaining
  1  9 representation or for any employee organization which has
  1 10 petitioned for certification or which has presented proof
  1 11 satisfactory to the board of support of ten percent or more of
  1 12 the public employees in the appropriate unit.
  1 13    2.  If a majority of the votes cast on the question is
  1 14 for no bargaining representation, the public employees in
  1 15 the bargaining unit found appropriate by the board shall not
  1 16 be represented by an employee organization. If a majority
  1 17 of the votes cast on the question is for a listed employee
  1 18 organization, then that employee organization shall represent
  1 19 the public employees in the bargaining unit found appropriate
  1 20 by the board.
  1 21    3.  If none of the choices on the ballot receives the vote
  1 22 of a majority of the public employees voting, the board shall
  1 23 conduct a runoff election among the two choices receiving the
  1 24 greatest number of votes.
  1 25    4.  Upon written objections filed by any party to the
  1 26 election within ten days after notice of the results of
  1 27 the election, if the board finds that misconduct or other
  1 28 circumstances prevented the public employees eligible to
  1 29 vote from freely expressing their preferences, the board may
  1 30 invalidate the election and hold a second election for the
  1 31 public employees.
  1 32    5.  Upon completion of a valid election in which the majority
  1 33 choice of the employees voting is determined, the board shall
  1 34 certify the results of the election and shall give reasonable
  1 35 notice of the order to all employee organizations listed on the
  2  1 ballot, the public employers, and the public employees in the
  2  2 appropriate bargaining unit.
  2  3    6.  a.  A petition for certification as exclusive bargaining
  2  4 representative of a bargaining unit shall not be considered
  2  5 by the board for a period of one year from the date of the
  2  6 noncertification of an employee organization as the exclusive
  2  7 bargaining representative of that bargaining unit following a
  2  8 certification election. A petition for certification as the
  2  9 exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall
  2 10 also not be considered by the board if the bargaining unit is
  2 11 at that time represented by a certified exclusive bargaining
  2 12 representative.
  2 13    b.  A petition for the decertification of the exclusive
  2 14 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall not be
  2 15 considered by the board for a period of one year from the date
  2 16 of its certification, or within one year of its continued
  2 17 certification following a decertification election, or during
  2 18 the duration of a collective bargaining agreement which, for
  2 19 purposes of this section, shall be deemed not to exceed two
  2 20 years. However, if a petition for decertification is filed
  2 21 during the duration of a collective bargaining agreement, the
  2 22 board shall award an election under this section not more than
  2 23 one hundred eighty days and not less than one hundred fifty
  2 24 days prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining
  2 25 agreement. If an employee organization is decertified, the
  2 26 board may receive petitions under section 20.14, provided that
  2 27 no such petition and no election conducted pursuant to such
  2 28 petition within one year from decertification shall include as
  2 29 a party the decertified employee organization.
  2 30    7.  A collective bargaining agreement with the state, its
  2 31 boards, commissions, departments, and agencies shall be for two
  2 32 years. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or
  2 33 arbitrator's award affecting state employees shall not provide
  2 34 for renegotiations which would require the refinancing of
  2 35 salary and fringe benefits for the second year of the term of
  3  1 the agreement, except as provided in section 20.17, subsection
  3  2 6. The effective date of any such agreement shall be July 1 of
  3  3 odd=numbered years, provided that if an exclusive bargaining
  3  4 representative is certified on a date which will prevent the
  3  5 negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement prior to
  3  6 July 1 of odd=numbered years for a period of two years, the
  3  7 certified collective bargaining representative may negotiate
  3  8 a one=year contract with the public employer which shall be
  3  9 effective from July 1 of the even=numbered year to July 1
  3 10 of the succeeding odd=numbered year when new contracts shall
  3 11 become effective.
  3 12    Sec. 2.  Section 22.7, subsection 69, Code 2018, is amended
  3 13 to read as follows:

  1  3    20.15  Elections.
  1  4    1.  Upon the filing of a petition for certification of an
  1  5 employee organization, the board shall submit a question to
  1  6 the public employees at an election in the bargaining unit
  1  7 found appropriate by the board. The question on the ballot
  1  8 shall permit the public employees to vote for no bargaining
  1  9 representation or for any employee organization which has
  1 10 petitioned for certification or which has presented proof
  1 11 satisfactory to the board of support of ten percent or more of
  1 12 the public employees in the appropriate unit.
  1 13    2.  If a majority of the votes cast on the question is
  1 14 for no bargaining representation, the public employees in
  1 15 the bargaining unit found appropriate by the board shall not
  1 16 be represented by an employee organization. If a majority
  1 17 of the votes cast on the question is for a listed employee
  1 18 organization, then that employee organization shall represent
  1 19 the public employees in the bargaining unit found appropriate
  1 20 by the board.
  1 21    3.  If none of the choices on the ballot receives the vote
  1 22 of a majority of the public employees voting, the board shall
  1 23 conduct a runoff election among the two choices receiving the

  1 25    4.  Upon written objections filed by any party to the
  1 26 election within ten days after notice of the results of
  1 27 the election, if the board finds that misconduct or other
  1 28 circumstances prevented the public employees eligible to
  1 29 vote from freely expressing their preferences, the board may

  2 12 representative.
  2 13    b.  A petition for the decertification of the exclusive
  2 14 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall not be

  1  3    20.15  Elections.
  1  4    1.  Upon the filing of a petition for certification of an
  1  5 employee organization, the board shall submit a question to
  1  6 the public employees at an election in the bargaining unit
  1  7 found appropriate by the board. The question on the ballot
  1  8 shall permit the public employees to vote for no bargaining
  1  9 representation or for any employee organization which has
  1 10 petitioned for certification or which has presented proof
  1 11 satisfactory to the board of support of ten percent or more of
  1 12 the public employees in the appropriate unit.
  1 13    2.  If a majority of the votes cast on the question is
  1 14 for no bargaining representation, the public employees in
  1 15 the bargaining unit found appropriate by the board shall not
  1 16 be represented by an employee organization. If a majority
  1 17 of the votes cast on the question is for a listed employee
  1 18 organization, then that employee organization shall represent
  1 19 the public employees in the bargaining unit found appropriate
  1 20 by the board.
  1 21    3.  If none of the choices on the ballot receives the vote
  1 22 of a majority of the public employees voting, the board shall
  1 23 conduct a runoff election among the two choices receiving the
  1 24 greatest number of votes.
  1 25    4.  Upon written objections filed by any party to the
  1 26 election within ten days after notice of the results of
  1 27 the election, if the board finds that misconduct or other
  1 28 circumstances prevented the public employees eligible to
  1 29 vote from freely expressing their preferences, the board may
  1 30 invalidate the election and hold a second election for the
  1 31 public employees.
  1 32    5.  Upon completion of a valid election in which the majority
  1 33 choice of the employees voting is determined, the board shall
  1 34 certify the results of the election and shall give reasonable
  1 35 notice of the order to all employee organizations listed on the
  2  1 ballot, the public employers, and the public employees in the
  2  2 appropriate bargaining unit.
  2  3    6.  a.  A petition for certification as exclusive bargaining
  2  4 representative of a bargaining unit shall not be considered
  2  5 by the board for a period of one year from the date of the
  2  6 noncertification of an employee organization as the exclusive
  2  7 bargaining representative of that bargaining unit following a

  2  9 exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall
  2 10 also not be considered by the board if the bargaining unit is
  2 11 at that time represented by a certified exclusive bargaining
  2 12 representative.
  2 13    b.  A petition for the decertification of the exclusive
  2 14 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall not be
  2 15 considered by the board for a period of one year from the date
  2 16 of its certification, or within one year of its continued
  2 17 certification following a decertification election, or during
  2 18 the duration of a collective bargaining agreement which, for
  2 19 purposes of this section, shall be deemed not to exceed two
  2 20 years. However, if a petition for decertification is filed
  2 21 during the duration of a collective bargaining agreement, the
  2 22 board shall award an election under this section not more than
  2 23 one hundred eighty days and not less than one hundred fifty
  2 24 days prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining
  2 25 agreement. If an employee organization is decertified, the
  2 26 board may receive petitions under section 20.14, provided that
  2 27 no such petition and no election conducted pursuant to such
  2 28 petition within one year from decertification shall include as
  2 29 a party the decertified employee organization.
  2 30    7.  A collective bargaining agreement with the state, its
  2 31 boards, commissions, departments, and agencies shall be for two
  2 32 years. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or
  2 33 arbitrator's award affecting state employees shall not provide

  3  4 representative is certified on a date which will prevent the
  3  5 negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement prior to

  1  2 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1  3    20.15  Elections.
  1  4    1.  Upon the filing of a petition for certification of an
  1  5 employee organization, the board shall submit a question to
  1  6 the public employees at an election in the bargaining unit
  1  7 found appropriate by the board. The question on the ballot
  1  8 shall permit the public employees to vote for no bargaining
  1  9 representation or for any employee organization which has
  1 10 petitioned for certification or which has presented proof
  1 11 satisfactory to the board of support of ten percent or more of
  1 12 the public employees in the appropriate unit.
  1 13    2.  If a majority of the votes cast on the question is
  1 14 for no bargaining representation, the public employees in
  1 15 the bargaining unit found appropriate by the board shall not
  1 16 be represented by an employee organization. If a majority
  1 17 of the votes cast on the question is for a listed employee
  1 18 organization, then that employee organization shall represent
  1 19 the public employees in the bargaining unit found appropriate
  1 20 by the board.
  1 21    3.  If none of the choices on the ballot receives the vote
  1 22 of a majority of the public employees voting, the board shall
  1 23 conduct a runoff election among the two choices receiving the
  1 24 greatest number of votes.
  1 25    4.  Upon written objections filed by any party to the
  1 26 election within ten days after notice of the results of
  1 27 the election, if the board finds that misconduct or other
  1 28 circumstances prevented the public employees eligible to
  1 29 vote from freely expressing their preferences, the board may
  1 30 invalidate the election and hold a second election for the
  1 31 public employees.
  1 32    5.  Upon completion of a valid election in which the majority
  1 33 choice of the employees voting is determined, the board shall
  1 34 certify the results of the election and shall give reasonable
  1 35 notice of the order to all employee organizations listed on the
  2  1 ballot, the public employers, and the public employees in the
  2  2 appropriate bargaining unit.
  2  3    6.  a.  A petition for certification as exclusive bargaining
  2  4 representative of a bargaining unit shall not be considered
  2  5 by the board for a period of one year from the date of the
  2  6 noncertification of an employee organization as the exclusive
  2  7 bargaining representative of that bargaining unit following a
  2  8 certification election. A petition for certification as the
  2  9 exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall
  2 10 also not be considered by the board if the bargaining unit is
  2 11 at that time represented by a certified exclusive bargaining
  2 12 representative.
  2 13    b.  A petition for the decertification of the exclusive
  2 14 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall not be
  2 15 considered by the board for a period of one year from the date
  2 16 of its certification, or within one year of its continued
  2 17 certification following a decertification election, or during
  2 18 the duration of a collective bargaining agreement which, for
  2 19 purposes of this section, shall be deemed not to exceed two
  2 20 years. However, if a petition for decertification is filed
  2 21 during the duration of a collective bargaining agreement, the
  2 22 board shall award an election under this section not more than
  2 23 one hundred eighty days and not less than one hundred fifty
  2 24 days prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining
  2 25 agreement. If an employee organization is decertified, the
  2 26 board may receive petitions under section 20.14, provided that
  2 27 no such petition and no election conducted pursuant to such
  2 28 petition within one year from decertification shall include as
  2 29 a party the decertified employee organization.
  2 30    7.  A collective bargaining agreement with the state, its
  2 31 boards, commissions, departments, and agencies shall be for two
  2 32 years. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or
  2 33 arbitrator's award affecting state employees shall not provide
  2 34 for renegotiations which would require the refinancing of
  2 35 salary and fringe benefits for the second year of the term of
  3  1 the agreement, except as provided in section 20.17, subsection
  3  2 6. The effective date of any such agreement shall be July 1 of
  3  3 odd=numbered years, provided that if an exclusive bargaining
  3  4 representative is certified on a date which will prevent the
  3  5 negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement prior to

  3  7 certified collective bargaining representative may negotiate
  3  8 a one=year contract with the public employer which shall be
  3  9 effective from July 1 of the even=numbered year to July 1
  3 10 of the succeeding odd=numbered year when new contracts shall

  1  4    1.  Upon the filing of a petition for certification of an
  1  5 employee organization, the board shall submit a question to
  1  6 the public employees at an election in the bargaining unit
  1  7 found appropriate by the board. The question on the ballot

  1 10 petitioned for certification or which has presented proof
  1 11 satisfactory to the board of support of ten percent or more of
  1 12 the public employees in the appropriate unit.
  1 13    2.  If a majority of the votes cast on the question is
  1 14 for no bargaining representation, the public employees in
  1 15 the bargaining unit found appropriate by the board shall not
  1 16 be represented by an employee organization. If a majority
  1 17 of the votes cast on the question is for a listed employee
  1 18 organization, then that employee organization shall represent
  1 19 the public employees in the bargaining unit found appropriate
  1 20 by the board.
  1 21    3.  If none of the choices on the ballot receives the vote
  1 22 of a majority of the public employees voting, the board shall
  1 23 conduct a runoff election among the two choices receiving the
  1 24 greatest number of votes.
  1 25    4.  Upon written objections filed by any party to the
  1 26 election within ten days after notice of the results of
  1 27 the election, if the board finds that misconduct or other
  1 28 circumstances prevented the public employees eligible to
  1 29 vote from freely expressing their preferences, the board may
  1 30 invalidate the election and hold a second election for the
  1 31 public employees.
  1 32    5.  Upon completion of a valid election in which the majority
  1 33 choice of the employees voting is determined, the board shall
  1 34 certify the results of the election and shall give reasonable
  1 35 notice of the order to all employee organizations listed on the
  2  1 ballot, the public employers, and the public employees in the
  2  2 appropriate bargaining unit.
  2  3    6.  a.  A petition for certification as exclusive bargaining
  2  4 representative of a bargaining unit shall not be considered
  2  5 by the board for a period of one year from the date of the
  2  6 noncertification of an employee organization as the exclusive
  2  7 bargaining representative of that bargaining unit following a
  2  8 certification election. A petition for certification as the
  2  9 exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall
  2 10 also not be considered by the board if the bargaining unit is
  2 11 at that time represented by a certified exclusive bargaining
  2 12 representative.
  2 13    b.  A petition for the decertification of the exclusive
  2 14 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit shall not be

  2 28 petition within one year from decertification shall include as
  2 29 a party the decertified employee organization.
  2 30    7.  A collective bargaining agreement with the state, its
  2 31 boards, commissions, departments, and agencies shall be for two
  2 32 years. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or
  2 33 arbitrator's award affecting state employees shall not provide
  2 34 for renegotiations which would require the refinancing of
  2 35 salary and fringe benefits for the second year of the term of
  3  1 the agreement, except as provided in section 20.17, subsection
  3  2 6. The effective date of any such agreement shall be July 1 of
  3  3 odd=numbered years, provided that if an exclusive bargaining
  3  4 representative is certified on a date which will prevent the
  3  5 negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement prior to

  3  7 certified collective bargaining representative may negotiate
  3  8 a one=year contract with the public employer which shall be
  3  9 effective from July 1 of the even=numbered year to July 1
  3 10 of the succeeding odd=numbered year when new contracts shall

  4 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 29    This bill strikes and rewrites Code section 20.15, relating
  4 30 to elections for employee organizations representing public
  4 31 employee collective bargaining units pursuant to Code chapter
  4 32 20. The bill strikes statutory changes made by 2017 Iowa Acts,
  4 33 ch. 2 (House File 291), and restores statutory language in
  4 34 effect prior to the enactment of 2017 Iowa Acts, ch. 2 (House
  4 35 File 291).
  5  1 The bill eliminates language providing for retention and
  5  2 recertification elections. The bill requires the public
  5  3 employment relations board to cancel any such elections
  5  4 scheduled or in process. The bill requires the board
  5  5 to consider a petition for certification of an employee
  5  6 organization as the exclusive representative of a bargaining
  5  7 unit for which an employee organization was not retained and
  5  8 recertified as the exclusive representative of that bargaining
  5  9 unit regardless of the amount of time that has elapsed since
  5 10 the retention and recertification election, notwithstanding
  5 11 prior requirements prohibiting such consideration for two
  5 12 years.
  5 13    The bill provides that the outcome of a certification or
  5 14 decertification election is determined by a majority vote of
  5 15 the members of the bargaining unit voting, rather than the
  5 16 total membership of the bargaining unit. The bill provides for
  5 17 a runoff election if none of the choices on the ballot in a
  5 18 certification election receives a majority vote of the members
  5 19 of the bargaining unit voting.
  5 20    The bill lowers the required percentage of support from
  5 21 employees in a bargaining unit required for an employee
  5 22 organization that did not submit a petition for certification
  5 23 as the exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit
  5 24 to be listed on the ballot for a certification election from 30
  5 25 percent to 10 percent.
  5 26    The bill strikes language prohibiting the board from
  5 27 considering a petition for certification as the exclusive
  5 28 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit unless a
  5 29 period of two years has elapsed from the date of the last
  5 30 certification election in which an employee organization
  5 31 was not certified as the exclusive representative of that
  5 32 bargaining unit or of the last decertification election in
  5 33 which an employee organization was decertified as the exclusive
  5 34 representative of that bargaining unit. The bill prohibits
  5 35 the board from considering a petition for certification as the
  6  1 exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit for
  6  2 one year after the employee organization is not certified in
  6  3 a certification election. The bill makes additional changes
  6  4 relating to the scheduling of decertification elections.
  6  5    The bill makes conforming changes.
  6  6    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies to all

  4 12    2.  Notwithstanding section 20.15, subsection 1, paragraph
  4 13 "c", Code 2018, the public employment relations board
  4 14 shall consider a petition for certification of an employee
  4 15 organization as the exclusive representative of a bargaining
  4 16 unit for which an employee organization was not retained and
  4 17 recertified as the exclusive representative of that bargaining
  4 18 unit regardless of the amount of time that has elapsed since
  4 19 the retention and recertification election at which an employee
  4 20 organization was not retained or recertified.

  4 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 29    This bill strikes and rewrites Code section 20.15, relating
  4 30 to elections for employee organizations representing public
  4 31 employee collective bargaining units pursuant to Code chapter
  4 32 20. The bill strikes statutory changes made by 2017 Iowa Acts,
  4 33 ch. 2 (House File 291), and restores statutory language in
  4 34 effect prior to the enactment of 2017 Iowa Acts, ch. 2 (House
  4 35 File 291).
  5  1 The bill eliminates language providing for retention and
  5  2 recertification elections. The bill requires the public
  5  3 employment relations board to cancel any such elections
  5  4 scheduled or in process. The bill requires the board
  5  5 to consider a petition for certification of an employee
  5  6 organization as the exclusive representative of a bargaining
  5  7 unit for which an employee organization was not retained and
  5  8 recertified as the exclusive representative of that bargaining
  5  9 unit regardless of the amount of time that has elapsed since
  5 10 the retention and recertification election, notwithstanding
  5 11 prior requirements prohibiting such consideration for two
  5 12 years.
  5 13    The bill provides that the outcome of a certification or
  5 14 decertification election is determined by a majority vote of
  5 15 the members of the bargaining unit voting, rather than the
  5 16 total membership of the bargaining unit. The bill provides for
  5 17 a runoff election if none of the choices on the ballot in a
  5 18 certification election receives a majority vote of the members
  5 19 of the bargaining unit voting.
  5 20    The bill lowers the required percentage of support from
  5 21 employees in a bargaining unit required for an employee
  5 22 organization that did not submit a petition for certification
  5 23 as the exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit
  5 24 to be listed on the ballot for a certification election from 30
  5 25 percent to 10 percent.
  5 26    The bill strikes language prohibiting the board from
  5 27 considering a petition for certification as the exclusive
  5 28 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit unless a
  5 29 period of two years has elapsed from the date of the last
  5 30 certification election in which an employee organization
  5 31 was not certified as the exclusive representative of that
  5 32 bargaining unit or of the last decertification election in
  5 33 which an employee organization was decertified as the exclusive
  5 34 representative of that bargaining unit. The bill prohibits
  5 35 the board from considering a petition for certification as the
  6  1 exclusive bargaining representative of a bargaining unit for
  6  2 one year after the employee organization is not certified in
  6  3 a certification election. The bill makes additional changes
