OVERVIEW.
The
bill
allows
a
patient
with
a
debilitating
6


medical
condition
(as
defined
in
the
bill)
who
receives
7


a
written
certification
from

that
the
patient
has
a
debilitating
medical

condition
and
who

along
with
10


an
application
to
the
department
of
public
health
(department)
11


for
a

registration
card

allow
12


for
the
lawful
use
of
a
medical
cannabis
preparation
to
treat
13


the
patient’s
debilitating
medical
condition.
A
patient
who
is
14


issued
a
medical
cannabis
preparation
registration
card
will
be
15


able
to
receive
a
medical
cannabis
preparation
directly
from
a
16


medical
cannabis
preparation
dispensary
operated
and
licensed
17


in
this

18


RECLASSIFICATION.
The
bill
reclassifies
marijuana,
19


including
tetrahydrocannabinols
as
a
schedule
II
controlled
20


substance
instead
of
a
schedule
I
controlled
substance
and
21


strikes
references
to
the
authority
of
the
board
of
pharmacy
to
22


adopt
rules
for
the
use
of
marijuana
or
tetrahydrocannabinols
23


for
medicinal
purposes.
24


A
schedule
I
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
25


substance
that
has
no
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
States
26


and
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
27


substance
that
has
an
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
28


States.
The
reclassification
of
marijuana
from
a
schedule
I
29


controlled
substance
to
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
30


would
allow
a
physician
to
issue
a
prescription
for
marijuana
31


under
state
law.
However,
federal
regulations
may
prohibit
32


such
prescriptions.
33


The
penalties
remain
unchanged
for
violations
involving

marijuana
under
