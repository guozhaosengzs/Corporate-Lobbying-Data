  1 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 12    This bill excludes equine boarding from the definition of
  1 13 farm tenancy under Iowa's real estate tenant=lessee law (Code
  1 14 chapter 562). Exclusion from the definition of farm tenancy
  1 15 results in a tenancy at will under which the tenancy can be
  1 16 terminated after a 30=day notice by either party to the lease
  1 17 agreement (Code section 562.4). Generally, all farm tenancies
  1 18 terminate on March 1, at the end of the farm tenant's crop
  1 19 year. However, in order to effectuate the termination one
  1 20 party to the lease must have given the other party written
  1 21 notice of termination by the previous September 1 (Code
  1 22 sections 562.5 through 562.7). Without such timely written
  1 23 notice of the termination, the lease continues under its same
  1 24 terms and conditions until the next September 1.
