  2 10                           EXPLANATION
  2 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 13    BILL'S SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code
  2 14 chapter 459, the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code
  2 15 chapter 459).  The bill amends provisions that require the
  2 16 department of natural resources (DNR) to approve or disapprove
  2 17 an application for a permit to construct a confinement feeding
  2 18 operation structure (structure) which is part of an existing or
  2 19 proposed  confinement feeding operation; sometimes referred to
  2 20 as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).  The bill
  2 21 provides that the application must state whether the CAFO is or
  2 22 could become a contract livestock facility.  It also provides
  2 23 that the statement must be included in the notice of a public
  2 24 hearing conducted by the board of supervisors (board) in the
  2 25 county where the proposed structure is to be constructed.
  2 26    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  2 27 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  2 28 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  2 29 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  2 30 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  2 31 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  2 32 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  2 33 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  2 34 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  2 35 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3  1 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3  2 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3  3 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3  4 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3  5 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must
  3  6 provide relevant information about the applicant, the proposed
  3  7 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing
  3  8 (Code section 459.304).
  3  9    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  3 10 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  3 11 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  3 12 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  3 13 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  3 14 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  3 15 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  3 16 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  3 17 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  3 18 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  3 19 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  3 20 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs a special equivalency
  3 21 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  3 22 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than

  3 29 contract producer of a commodity, including livestock, and
  3 30 the Code chapter includes a number of defined terms (Code
  3 31 section 202.1).  A contractor is a person who enters into an
  3 32 agreement with an agricultural producer to raise livestock on
  3 33 property held by the agricultural producer (contract livestock
  3 34 facility).  The agricultural producer is referred to as a
  3 35 contract producer.  The contract is referred to as a production
  4  1 contract.  Livestock is limited to beef cattle, dairy cattle,
  4  2 sheep, or swine, but does not include horses, chickens,
  4  3 turkeys, or fish.

  2 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 13    BILL'S SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS.  This bill amends Code
  2 14 chapter 459, the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code
  2 15 chapter 459).  The bill amends provisions that require the
  2 16 department of natural resources (DNR) to approve or disapprove
  2 17 an application for a permit to construct a confinement feeding
  2 18 operation structure (structure) which is part of an existing or
  2 19 proposed  confinement feeding operation; sometimes referred to
  2 20 as a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO).  The bill
  2 21 provides that the application must state whether the CAFO is or
  2 22 could become a contract livestock facility.  It also provides
  2 23 that the statement must be included in the notice of a public
  2 24 hearing conducted by the board of supervisors (board) in the
  2 25 county where the proposed structure is to be constructed.
  2 26    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  2 27 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  2 28 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  2 29 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  2 30 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  2 31 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  2 32 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  2 33 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  2 34 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  2 35 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3  1 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3  2 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3  3 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3  4 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3  5 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must
  3  6 provide relevant information about the applicant, the proposed
  3  7 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing

  3 11 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  3 12 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  3 13 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  3 14 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  3 15 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  3 16 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  3 17 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  3 18 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  3 19 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  3 20 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs a special equivalency
  3 21 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.

  2 26    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  DNR's responsibility to
  2 27 approve or disapprove a permit application and a board's right
  2 28 to review and evaluate the application is based on several
  2 29 factors: (1) a CAFO's capacity (1,000 or more animal units
  2 30 or AUs) or (2) the construction of an unformed manure storage
  2 31 structure.  A special exemption applies to a CAFO owned by
  2 32 a research college (Code section 459.303).  As part of the
  2 33 process, the permit application must be filed with DNR and the
  2 34 board in the county where the construction is to occur.  The
  2 35 board may hold a public hearing to receive public comments
  3  1 regarding the application and forward its comments and public
  3  2 comments to DNR prior to the agency's decision to approve
  3  3 or disapprove the application. The board is required to
  3  4 publish a notice of a scheduled public hearing in a newspaper
  3  5 having a general circulation in the county.  The notice must
  3  6 provide relevant information about the applicant, the proposed
  3  7 construction, and the time and place of the public hearing
  3  8 (Code section 459.304).
  3  9    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  3 10 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  3 11 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  3 12 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  3 13 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  3 14 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  3 15 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  3 16 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  3 17 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  3 18 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  3 19 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  3 20 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs a special equivalency
  3 21 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  3 22 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3 23 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs.  For purposes
  3 24 of calculating the permit threshold for a CAFO maintaining such
  3 25 swine the AU capacity must equal a minimum of 2,500 (1,000 ?
  3 26 0.4 = 2,500).

  3 29 contract producer of a commodity, including livestock, and
  3 30 the Code chapter includes a number of defined terms (Code
  3 31 section 202.1).  A contractor is a person who enters into an
  3 32 agreement with an agricultural producer to raise livestock on
  3 33 property held by the agricultural producer (contract livestock
  3 34 facility).  The agricultural producer is referred to as a
  3 35 contract producer.  The contract is referred to as a production
  4  1 contract.  Livestock is limited to beef cattle, dairy cattle,
  4  2 sheep, or swine, but does not include horses, chickens,
  4  3 turkeys, or fish.

  3 11 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  3 12 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  3 13 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  3 14 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  3 15 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  3 16 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of

  3  9    BACKGROUND == TERMS == CAFOs. Code chapter 459 includes
  3 10 a number of defined terms (Code section 459.102).  An animal
  3 11 feeding operation refers to any area in which animals are
  3 12 confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any
  3 13 12=month period.  A CAFO is a type of animal feeding operation
  3 14 that includes a totally roofed building where confined animals
  3 15 are maintained (as compared to an open feedlot).  An unformed
  3 16 manure storage structure has walls and a bottom composed of
  3 17 earth or nondurable materials as compared with a formed manure
  3 18 storage structure often constructed of concrete. Confined
  3 19 animals are limited to cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens,
  3 20 turkeys, or fish.  In calculating AUs a special equivalency
  3 21 factor is assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  3 22 For example, each butcher or breeding swine weighing more than
  3 23 55 pounds has an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs.  For purposes
  3 24 of calculating the permit threshold for a CAFO maintaining such
  3 25 swine the AU capacity must equal a minimum of 2,500 (1,000 ?
  3 26 0.4 = 2,500).
  3 27    BACKGROUND == TERMS == PRODUCTION CONTRACTS.  Code chapter

  3 29 contract producer of a commodity, including livestock, and
  3 30 the Code chapter includes a number of defined terms (Code
  3 31 section 202.1).  A contractor is a person who enters into an
  3 32 agreement with an agricultural producer to raise livestock on
  3 33 property held by the agricultural producer (contract livestock
  3 34 facility).  The agricultural producer is referred to as a
  3 35 contract producer.  The contract is referred to as a production
  4  1 contract.  Livestock is limited to beef cattle, dairy cattle,
