  7  6    Sec. 8.  CONTINGENT EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect
  7  7 upon the effective date of a United States department of
  7  8 labor's regulation amending 29 C.F.R. pt. 2510 in such a manner
  7  9 as to allow the creation of association health plans consistent
  7 10 with the provisions of this Act.
  7 11                           EXPLANATION
  7 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 14    This bill relates to association health plans, a type of
  7 15 multiple employer welfare arrangement, established by bona fide
  7 16 associations of employers.
  7 17    The United States department of labor issued proposed
  7 18 rules in 83 Fed. Reg. 617 (January 5, 2018) that broaden the
  7 19 criteria under Title I of the federal Employee Retirement
  7 20 Income Security Act (ERISA) to allow more employers to form
  7 21 an association health plan to offer a group health plan
  7 22 to employees, former employees, family members, and other
  7 23 beneficiaries of the employer members of the association.
  7 24    Currently, employer groups are prohibited from forming
  7 25 associations for the sole purpose of providing group health
  7 26 coverage. Under the proposed federal regulations, an
  7 27 association may exist solely for the purpose of sponsoring
  7 28 a group health plan for its employer members. The current
  7 29 commonality=of=interest regulations require employer members
  7 30 to have a commonality=of=interest such as the same trade,
  7 31 industry, line of business, or profession. The proposed
  7 32 federal regulations, and the bill, also allow the commonality
  7 33 to be based on the employer members having a principal place
  7 34 of business in the same state or the same metropolitan area,
  7 35 including a metropolitan area that crosses state lines.
  8  1 The bill requires each employer member of the association
  8  2 to act directly as the employer of at least one employee that
  8  3 participates in the group health plan. The bill outlines
  8  4 the criteria for a self=employed individual to be classified
  8  5 as both an employer and employee for purposes of joining
  8  6 an association. Each employer member must control the
  8  7 functions of the association by electing directors or other
  8  8 officers of the association and the association must have an
  8  9 organizational structure that includes a governing body and
  8 10 bylaws. The association cannot be a health insurance issuer or
  8 11 be controlled by one. Other requirements for an association
  8 12 health plan to comply with federal and state requirements are
  8 13 outlined in the bill. To ensure compliance, the bill allows
  8 14 the commissioner of insurance to enter into an agreement
  8 15 to exchange information with an insurance regulator in a
  8 16 contiguous state if an association health plan has employer
  8 17 members in this state and the contiguous state.
  8 18    The bill outlines the nondiscrimination provisions,
  8 19 including eligibility for coverage provisions, that an
  8 20 association health plan must comply with. The bill requires
  8 21 the commissioner to adopt rules to administer the bill and
  8 22 allows the commissioner to take any enforcement action under
  8 23 the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the
  8 24 bill. The commissioner may engage in emergency rulemaking
  8 25 as necessary. An association health plan that meets all the
  8 26 requirements of the bill shall not be considered an insurance
  8 27 company or association under Code section 432.1, a member of
  8 28 the Iowa individual health benefit reinsurance association
  8 29 under Code section 513C.10, or a member insurer of the Iowa
  8 30 life and health insurance guaranty association under Code
  8 31 section 508C.5.
  8 32    The bill amends Code section 507A.4, unauthorized insurers,
  8 33 to update the language related to the exemption from the
  8 34 provisions of the Code section for multiple employer welfare
  8 35 arrangements. The bill also includes a provision to exempt
  9  1 association health care plans from Code section 507A.4.
  9  2    The bill amends Code section 509.1 to allow a policy of
  9  3 group health insurance sponsored by an association health plan
  9  4 pursuant to the provisions of the bill to be delivered in the
  9  5 state. The bill takes effect upon the effective date of a
  9  6 United States department of labor's regulation amending 29
  9  7 C.F.R. pt. 2510 that allows the creation of association health
  9  8 plans.

  7 11                           EXPLANATION
  7 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 14    This bill relates to association health plans, a type of
  7 15 multiple employer welfare arrangement, established by bona fide
  7 16 associations of employers.
  7 17    The United States department of labor issued proposed
  7 18 rules in 83 Fed. Reg. 617 (January 5, 2018) that broaden the
  7 19 criteria under Title I of the federal Employee Retirement
  7 20 Income Security Act (ERISA) to allow more employers to form
  7 21 an association health plan to offer a group health plan
  7 22 to employees, former employees, family members, and other
  7 23 beneficiaries of the employer members of the association.
  7 24    Currently, employer groups are prohibited from forming
  7 25 associations for the sole purpose of providing group health
  7 26 coverage. Under the proposed federal regulations, an
  7 27 association may exist solely for the purpose of sponsoring
  7 28 a group health plan for its employer members. The current
  7 29 commonality=of=interest regulations require employer members
  7 30 to have a commonality=of=interest such as the same trade,
  7 31 industry, line of business, or profession. The proposed
  7 32 federal regulations, and the bill, also allow the commonality
  7 33 to be based on the employer members having a principal place
  7 34 of business in the same state or the same metropolitan area,
  7 35 including a metropolitan area that crosses state lines.
  8  1 The bill requires each employer member of the association
  8  2 to act directly as the employer of at least one employee that
  8  3 participates in the group health plan. The bill outlines
  8  4 the criteria for a self=employed individual to be classified
  8  5 as both an employer and employee for purposes of joining
  8  6 an association. Each employer member must control the
  8  7 functions of the association by electing directors or other
  8  8 officers of the association and the association must have an
  8  9 organizational structure that includes a governing body and
  8 10 bylaws. The association cannot be a health insurance issuer or
  8 11 be controlled by one. Other requirements for an association
  8 12 health plan to comply with federal and state requirements are
  8 13 outlined in the bill. To ensure compliance, the bill allows
  8 14 the commissioner of insurance to enter into an agreement
  8 15 to exchange information with an insurance regulator in a
  8 16 contiguous state if an association health plan has employer
  8 17 members in this state and the contiguous state.
  8 18    The bill outlines the nondiscrimination provisions,
  8 19 including eligibility for coverage provisions, that an
  8 20 association health plan must comply with. The bill requires
  8 21 the commissioner to adopt rules to administer the bill and
  8 22 allows the commissioner to take any enforcement action under
  8 23 the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the
  8 24 bill. The commissioner may engage in emergency rulemaking
  8 25 as necessary. An association health plan that meets all the
  8 26 requirements of the bill shall not be considered an insurance
  8 27 company or association under Code section 432.1, a member of
  8 28 the Iowa individual health benefit reinsurance association
  8 29 under Code section 513C.10, or a member insurer of the Iowa
  8 30 life and health insurance guaranty association under Code
  8 31 section 508C.5.
  8 32    The bill amends Code section 507A.4, unauthorized insurers,
  8 33 to update the language related to the exemption from the
  8 34 provisions of the Code section for multiple employer welfare
  8 35 arrangements. The bill also includes a provision to exempt
  9  1 association health care plans from Code section 507A.4.
  9  2    The bill amends Code section 509.1 to allow a policy of
  9  3 group health insurance sponsored by an association health plan
  9  4 pursuant to the provisions of the bill to be delivered in the
  9  5 state. The bill takes effect upon the effective date of a
  9  6 United States department of labor's regulation amending 29
  9  7 C.F.R. pt. 2510 that allows the creation of association health
  9  8 plans.

  7 10 with the provisions of this Act.
  7 11                           EXPLANATION
  7 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 14    This bill relates to association health plans, a type of
  7 15 multiple employer welfare arrangement, established by bona fide
  7 16 associations of employers.
  7 17    The United States department of labor issued proposed
  7 18 rules in 83 Fed. Reg. 617 (January 5, 2018) that broaden the
  7 19 criteria under Title I of the federal Employee Retirement
  7 20 Income Security Act (ERISA) to allow more employers to form
  7 21 an association health plan to offer a group health plan
  7 22 to employees, former employees, family members, and other
  7 23 beneficiaries of the employer members of the association.
  7 24    Currently, employer groups are prohibited from forming
  7 25 associations for the sole purpose of providing group health
  7 26 coverage. Under the proposed federal regulations, an
  7 27 association may exist solely for the purpose of sponsoring
  7 28 a group health plan for its employer members. The current
  7 29 commonality=of=interest regulations require employer members
  7 30 to have a commonality=of=interest such as the same trade,
  7 31 industry, line of business, or profession. The proposed
  7 32 federal regulations, and the bill, also allow the commonality
  7 33 to be based on the employer members having a principal place
  7 34 of business in the same state or the same metropolitan area,
  7 35 including a metropolitan area that crosses state lines.
  8  1 The bill requires each employer member of the association
  8  2 to act directly as the employer of at least one employee that
  8  3 participates in the group health plan. The bill outlines
  8  4 the criteria for a self=employed individual to be classified
  8  5 as both an employer and employee for purposes of joining
  8  6 an association. Each employer member must control the
  8  7 functions of the association by electing directors or other
  8  8 officers of the association and the association must have an
  8  9 organizational structure that includes a governing body and
  8 10 bylaws. The association cannot be a health insurance issuer or
  8 11 be controlled by one. Other requirements for an association
  8 12 health plan to comply with federal and state requirements are
  8 13 outlined in the bill. To ensure compliance, the bill allows
  8 14 the commissioner of insurance to enter into an agreement
  8 15 to exchange information with an insurance regulator in a
  8 16 contiguous state if an association health plan has employer
  8 17 members in this state and the contiguous state.
  8 18    The bill outlines the nondiscrimination provisions,
  8 19 including eligibility for coverage provisions, that an
  8 20 association health plan must comply with. The bill requires
  8 21 the commissioner to adopt rules to administer the bill and
  8 22 allows the commissioner to take any enforcement action under
  8 23 the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the
  8 24 bill. The commissioner may engage in emergency rulemaking
  8 25 as necessary. An association health plan that meets all the
  8 26 requirements of the bill shall not be considered an insurance
  8 27 company or association under Code section 432.1, a member of
  8 28 the Iowa individual health benefit reinsurance association
  8 29 under Code section 513C.10, or a member insurer of the Iowa
  8 30 life and health insurance guaranty association under Code
  8 31 section 508C.5.
  8 32    The bill amends Code section 507A.4, unauthorized insurers,
  8 33 to update the language related to the exemption from the
  8 34 provisions of the Code section for multiple employer welfare
  8 35 arrangements. The bill also includes a provision to exempt
  9  1 association health care plans from Code section 507A.4.
  9  2    The bill amends Code section 509.1 to allow a policy of
  9  3 group health insurance sponsored by an association health plan
  9  4 pursuant to the provisions of the bill to be delivered in the
  9  5 state. The bill takes effect upon the effective date of a
  9  6 United States department of labor's regulation amending 29
  9  7 C.F.R. pt. 2510 that allows the creation of association health
  9  8 plans.

  7 27 association may exist solely for the purpose of sponsoring
  7 28 a group health plan for its employer members. The current
  7 29 commonality=of=interest regulations require employer members
  7 30 to have a commonality=of=interest such as the same trade,
  7 31 industry, line of business, or profession. The proposed
  7 32 federal regulations, and the bill, also allow the commonality
  7 33 to be based on the employer members having a principal place
  7 34 of business in the same state or the same metropolitan area,
  7 35 including a metropolitan area that crosses state lines.
  8  1 The bill requires each employer member of the association
  8  2 to act directly as the employer of at least one employee that
  8  3 participates in the group health plan. The bill outlines
  8  4 the criteria for a self=employed individual to be classified
  8  5 as both an employer and employee for purposes of joining
  8  6 an association. Each employer member must control the
  8  7 functions of the association by electing directors or other
  8  8 officers of the association and the association must have an
  8  9 organizational structure that includes a governing body and
  8 10 bylaws. The association cannot be a health insurance issuer or
  8 11 be controlled by one. Other requirements for an association
  8 12 health plan to comply with federal and state requirements are
  8 13 outlined in the bill. To ensure compliance, the bill allows
  8 14 the commissioner of insurance to enter into an agreement
  8 15 to exchange information with an insurance regulator in a
  8 16 contiguous state if an association health plan has employer
  8 17 members in this state and the contiguous state.
  8 18    The bill outlines the nondiscrimination provisions,
  8 19 including eligibility for coverage provisions, that an

  8 22 allows the commissioner to take any enforcement action under
  8 23 the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the
  8 24 bill. The commissioner may engage in emergency rulemaking
  8 25 as necessary. An association health plan that meets all the
  8 26 requirements of the bill shall not be considered an insurance
  8 27 company or association under Code section 432.1, a member of
  8 28 the Iowa individual health benefit reinsurance association

  7 11                           EXPLANATION
  7 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 14    This bill relates to association health plans, a type of
  7 15 multiple employer welfare arrangement, established by bona fide
  7 16 associations of employers.
  7 17    The United States department of labor issued proposed
  7 18 rules in 83 Fed. Reg. 617 (January 5, 2018) that broaden the
  7 19 criteria under Title I of the federal Employee Retirement
  7 20 Income Security Act (ERISA) to allow more employers to form
  7 21 an association health plan to offer a group health plan
  7 22 to employees, former employees, family members, and other
  7 23 beneficiaries of the employer members of the association.
  7 24    Currently, employer groups are prohibited from forming
  7 25 associations for the sole purpose of providing group health
  7 26 coverage. Under the proposed federal regulations, an
  7 27 association may exist solely for the purpose of sponsoring
  7 28 a group health plan for its employer members. The current
  7 29 commonality=of=interest regulations require employer members
  7 30 to have a commonality=of=interest such as the same trade,
  7 31 industry, line of business, or profession. The proposed
  7 32 federal regulations, and the bill, also allow the commonality
  7 33 to be based on the employer members having a principal place
  7 34 of business in the same state or the same metropolitan area,
  7 35 including a metropolitan area that crosses state lines.
  8  1 The bill requires each employer member of the association
  8  2 to act directly as the employer of at least one employee that
  8  3 participates in the group health plan. The bill outlines
  8  4 the criteria for a self=employed individual to be classified
  8  5 as both an employer and employee for purposes of joining
  8  6 an association. Each employer member must control the
  8  7 functions of the association by electing directors or other
  8  8 officers of the association and the association must have an
  8  9 organizational structure that includes a governing body and
  8 10 bylaws. The association cannot be a health insurance issuer or
  8 11 be controlled by one. Other requirements for an association
  8 12 health plan to comply with federal and state requirements are
  8 13 outlined in the bill. To ensure compliance, the bill allows
  8 14 the commissioner of insurance to enter into an agreement
  8 15 to exchange information with an insurance regulator in a
  8 16 contiguous state if an association health plan has employer
  8 17 members in this state and the contiguous state.
  8 18    The bill outlines the nondiscrimination provisions,
  8 19 including eligibility for coverage provisions, that an
  8 20 association health plan must comply with. The bill requires
  8 21 the commissioner to adopt rules to administer the bill and
  8 22 allows the commissioner to take any enforcement action under
  8 23 the commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the
  8 24 bill. The commissioner may engage in emergency rulemaking
  8 25 as necessary. An association health plan that meets all the
  8 26 requirements of the bill shall not be considered an insurance
  8 27 company or association under Code section 432.1, a member of
  8 28 the Iowa individual health benefit reinsurance association
  8 29 under Code section 513C.10, or a member insurer of the Iowa
  8 30 life and health insurance guaranty association under Code
  8 31 section 508C.5.
  8 32    The bill amends Code section 507A.4, unauthorized insurers,
  8 33 to update the language related to the exemption from the
  8 34 provisions of the Code section for multiple employer welfare
  8 35 arrangements. The bill also includes a provision to exempt
  9  1 association health care plans from Code section 507A.4.
  9  2    The bill amends Code section 509.1 to allow a policy of
  9  3 group health insurance sponsored by an association health plan
  9  4 pursuant to the provisions of the bill to be delivered in the
  9  5 state. The bill takes effect upon the effective date of a
  9  6 United States department of labor's regulation amending 29
  9  7 C.F.R. pt. 2510 that allows the creation of association health
  9  8 plans.
