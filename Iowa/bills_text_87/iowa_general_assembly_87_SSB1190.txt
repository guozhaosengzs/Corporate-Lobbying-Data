RECLASSIFICATION.
The
bill
reclassifies
marijuana,
4


including
tetrahydrocannabinols
as
a
schedule
II
controlled
5


substance
instead
of
a
schedule
I
controlled
substance
and
6


strikes
references
to
the
authority
of
the
board
of
pharmacy
to
7


adopt
rules
for
the
use
of
marijuana
or
tetrahydrocannabinols
8


for
medicinal
purposes.
9


A
schedule
I
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
10


substance
that
has
no
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
States
11


and
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
12


substance
that
has
an
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
13


States.
The
reclassification
of
marijuana
from
a
schedule
I
14


controlled
substance
to
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
15


would
allow
a
physician
to
issue
a
prescription
for
marijuana
16


under
state
law.
However,
federal
regulations
may
prohibit
17


such
prescriptions.
18


The
penalties
remain
unchanged
for
violations
involving
19


marijuana
under
the
bill.
The
penalties
under
Code
section
20


124.401
range
from
a
class
“B”
felony
punishable
by
up
to
50
21


years
of
confinement
to
a
serious
misdemeanor
punishable
by
22


up
to
six
months
of
confinement
depending
on
the
amount
of
23


marijuana
involved
in
the
offense.
24


The
bill
amends
Code
section
124.401,
relating
to
prohibited
25


acts
involving
controlled
substances,
to
provide
that
it
