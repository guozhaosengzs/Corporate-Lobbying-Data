Purpose
and
definitions.

1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
the
general
welfare
and
10


well-being
of
the
state
are
directly
related
to
educational
11


levels
and
skills
of
the
citizens
of
the
state,
and
that
a
12


vital
and
valid
public
purpose
is
served
by
the
creation
and
13


implementation
of
programs
which
encourage
and
make
possible
14


the
attainment
of
higher


formal
education
by
the
greatest
15


number
of
citizens
of
the
state.
The
state
has
limited
16


resources
to
provide
additional
programs
for
higher
education
17


funding
and
the
continued
operation
and
maintenance
of
the


18


state’s
public
institutions
of
higher
education
and
the


general
19


welfare
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
will
be
enhanced
by
20


establishing
a
program
which
allows
citizens
of
the
state
to
21


invest
money
in
a
public
trust
for
future
application
to
the
22


payment
of
higher
education
costs


qualified
education
expenses
.
23


The
creation
of
the
means
of
encouragement
for
citizens
to
24


invest
in
such
a
program
represents
the
carrying
out
of
a
25


vital
and
valid
public
purpose.
In
order
to
make
available
26


to
the
citizens
of
the
state
an
opportunity
to
fund
future
27


higher
formal
education
needs,
it
is
necessary
that
a
public
28


trust
be
established
in
which
moneys
may
be
invested
for
future
29


educational
use.

DIVISION
II
——
INCOME
AND
FRANCHISE
TAX
CHANGES
BEGINNING
IN
20


2019.
Division
II
makes
numerous
changes
to
the
individual
and
21


corporate
income
tax
and
franchise
tax.
22


INDIVIDUAL
INCOME
TAX.
Under
current
law,
the
starting
23


point
for
computing
the
Iowa
individual
income
tax
is
federal
24


adjusted
gross
income
before
the
net
operating
loss
deduction,
25


which
is
generally
a
taxpayer’s
gross
income
minus
several
26


deductions.
From
that
point,
Iowa
requires
several
adjustments
27


and
then
provides
taxpayers
with
a
deduction
for
federal
income
28


taxes
paid,
and
the
option
to
deduct
a
standard
deduction
or
29


itemized
deductions.
The
bill
changes
the
starting
point
for
30


computing
the
individual
income
tax
to
federal
taxable
income,
31


which
includes
all
deductions
and
adjustments
taken
at
the
32


federal
level
in
computing
tax,
including
a
standard
deduction
33


or
itemized
deductions,
and
the
new
qualified
business
income
34


deduction
allowed
for
certain
income
earned
from

_____


entity.
Because
the
starting
point
will
now
be
federal
taxable
1


income,
and
federal
law
does
not
provide
for
the
filing
status
2


of
married
filing
separately
on
a
combined
return,
the
bill
3


repeals
that
filing
status
option
for
Iowa
tax
purposes.
4


Because
net
operating
loss
will
no
longer
be
calculated
5


at
the
state
level,
the
bill
requires
taxpayers
to
add
back
6


any
federal
net
operating
loss
deduction
carried
over
from
a
7


taxable
year
beginning
prior
to
January
1,
2019,
but
allows
8


taxpayers
to
deduct
any
remaining
Iowa
net
operating
loss
from
9


a
prior
taxable
year.
10


The
bill
repeals
the
alternative
minimum
tax,
and
also
11


repeals
most
deductions
and
exclusions
previously
available
12


when
computing
net
income
and
taxable
income
under
Iowa
law,
13


including
the
Iowa
optional
standard
deduction
and
all
itemized
14


deductions,
and
the
ability
to
deduct
federal
income
taxes,
15


except
for
a
one-year
phase-out
in
2019
for
taxes
paid,
or
16


refunds
received,
that
relate
to
a
prior
year.
17


The
bill
keeps
the
deduction
for
military
pension
income
18


or
military
active
duty
pay.
The
bill
also
keeps
the
general
19


pension
exclusion
available
under
current
law,
and
increases
20


it
from
$6,000
($12,000
for
married
filing
jointly)
to
$10,000
21


($20,000
for
married
filing
jointly).
22


The
bill
maintains
the
deductions
for
contributions
to
the
23


Iowa
529
plan,
the
Iowa
ABLE
plan,
the
first-time
homebuyer
24


savings
account,
the
deduction
for
social
security
retirement
25


benefits,
the
deduction
for
certain
payments
received
for
26


providing
unskilled
in-home
health
care,
for
contributions
27


to
an
individual
development
account,
for
certain
amounts
28


received
from
the
veterans
trust
fund,
for
victim
compensation
29


awards,
and
for
biodiesel
production
refunds.
The
bill
30


keeps
the
deductions
for
certain
wages
paid
to
individuals
31


with
disabilities
or
individuals
previously
convicted
of
a
32


felony,
and
for
certain
organ
donations,
but
only
for
tax
years
33


beginning
before
January
1,
2022.
34


The
bill
provides
a
new
deduction
for
any

employee
resulting
from
the
payment
by
an
employer,
whether
1


paid
to
the
employee
or
to
a
lender,
of
principal
or
interest
2


on
the
employee’s
qualified
education
loan.
3


Federal
income
tax
law
does
provide
a
limited
deduction
for
4


a
taxpayer’s
payment
of
interest
on
qualified
education
loans,
5


and
the
bill
disallows
the
deduction
provided
in
the
bill
for
6


any
amount
of
income
that
represents
an
interest
payment
that
7


was
also
deducted
by
the
employee
in
computing
federal
taxable
8


income.
9


The
term
“qualified
education
loan”
is
defined
to
mean
the
10


same
as
it
does
under
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
(IRC),
and
11


generally
includes
debt
incurred
on
behalf
of
a
taxpayer,
or
a
12


taxpayer’s
spouse
or
dependent,
to
pay
expenses
of
attending
13


institutions
of
higher
education
participating
in
the
federal
14


student
financial
aid
programs.
15


Under
current
law,
the
Iowa
individual
income
tax
conforms
16


to
the
IRC
as
of
a
certain
date,
and
the
general
assembly
17


chooses
to
couple
or
decouple
with
changes
to
the
IRC
through
18


legislation.
The
bill
changes
this
conformity
by
permanently
19


coupling
with
the
IRC.
This
permanent
coupling
has
the
effect
20


of
incorporating
into
Iowa
tax
law
all
the
changes
made
to
21


the
IRC
since
2015,
including
changes
made
in
the
federal
22


Protecting
Americans
from
Tax
Hikes
Act
of
2015,
and
the
23


federal
Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
2017.
This

to
the
bonus
depreciation
allowance.
1


Current
law
provides
nine
regular
tax
brackets
containing
2


progressively
higher
amounts
of
taxable
income
that
are
taxed
3


at
progressively
higher
tax
rates,
from
a
low
of
0.36
percent,
4


to
a
high
of
8.98
percent.
The
taxable
income
amounts
in
each
5


tax
bracket
are
indexed
to
inflation
and
increased
each
year.
6


The
bill
reduces
the
number
of
brackets
to
five
and
modifies
7


the
tax
rates
as
follows:

Income

$75,000
6.00%
13


5)
$75,000
or
more
6.60%
14


The
bill
further
reduces
the
top
tax
rate
from
6.60%
to
6.50%
15


in
tax
year
2020,
to
6.40%
in
tax
year
2021,
and
to
6.30%
for
16


tax
year
2022
and
beyond.
For
a
married
couple
filing
a
joint
17


return,
the
bill
provides
that
all
of
the
income
amounts
in
18


each
bracket
above
are
doubled.
Finally,
the
bill
provides
19


that
beginning
in
2023,
all
of
the
tax
rates
will
be
indexed
to
20


inflation
and
reduced
each
year.
21


CORPORATE
INCOME
TAX
AND
FRANCHISE
TAX.
The
starting
point
22


for
calculating
the
corporate
income
tax
and
the
franchise
23


tax
is
federal
taxable
income
before
the
net
operating
loss
24


deduction,
because
net
operating
loss
is
calculated
at
the
25


state
level.
The
bill
repeals
the
separate
calculation
of
26


net
operating
loss
at
the
state
level.
As
a
result,
the
bill
27


requires
taxpayers
to
add
back
any
federal
net
operating
loss
28


deduction
carried
over
from
a
taxable
year
beginning
prior
to
29


January
1,
2019,
but
allows
taxpayers
to
deduct
any
remaining
30


Iowa
net
operating
loss
from
a
prior
taxable
year.
31


The
bill
repeals
the
alternative
minimum
tax
for
the
32


corporate
income
tax,
and
also
repeals
most
deductions
and
33


exclusions
previously
available
when
computing
net
income
and
34


taxable
income
under
Iowa
law,
including

for

that
relate

The

Under
current
law,
the
Iowa
corporate
income
tax
and
7


franchise
tax
conforms
to
the
IRC
as
of
a
certain
date,
and
the
8


general
assembly
chooses
to
couple
or
decouple
with
changes
to
9


the
IRC
through
legislation.
The
bill
changes
this
conformity
10


by
permanently
coupling
with
the
IRC.
This
permanent
coupling
11


has
the
effect
of
incorporating
into
Iowa
tax
law
all
the
12


changes
made
to
the
IRC
since
2015,
including
changes
made
in
13


the
federal
Protecting
Americans
from
Tax
Hikes
Act
of
2015,
14


and
the
federal
Tax
Cuts
and
Jobs
Act
of
2017.
This
permanent
15


coupling
also
has
the
effect
of
automatically
incorporating
16


into
Iowa
tax
law
any
future
changes
that
may
be
made
to
the
17


IRC,
unless
the
general
assembly
were
to
affirmatively
decouple
18


from
a

provision
through

However,
the
bill
does
decouple
from
the
federal
additional
20


first-year
depreciation
allowance
in
section
168(k)
of
the
21


IRC.
By
decoupling,
taxpayers
who
claim
bonus
depreciation
22


for
federal
tax
purposes
are
required
to
add
such
depreciation
23


amounts

Iowa
net
income,
but
are
then
allowed
under
24


existing
state
law
to
deduct
the
amount
of
depreciation
that
25


would
otherwise
be
allowable
under
federal
law,
without

to
the

Current

These

27


The

strikes
the

of
“higher

costs”,
28


as
well
as
numerous
references
to
that
term
throughout
the
Iowa
29


529
plan,
and
replaces
them
with
the
term
“qualified

30


expenses”,
which
is
defined
in
the
bill
to
mean
the
same
as
31


qualified

§529
to
allow
certain

from
a
qualified

7


program
to
an
ABLE
account
without
incurring

14


Several
other

are
made
to
the
Iowa
529
plan
15


to
remove
references
to
the
imposition
of
penalties
for
16


cancellation
and
late
payments
under
the
trust,
to
remove
17


certain
references
to
the
ability
to
amend

18


agreements,
to
describe
rules
and
procedures
for
determining

successors
in

The
exemption
specifies
that
such
a

qualify
as
26


a

the
commercial

if
its

16


The
bill
also
repeals
numerous

17


related
to
agricultural

and
creates
a
new

19


primarily

12


tax
in
Code
chapter
423A
and
the
automobile
rental
excise
tax
13


in
Code
chapter
423C
to
expand
the

16


Current

each
excise

the
excise
tax.
The
bill
amends

to
more
broadly
19


include
any
person
who

21


rents
lodging
or
an

lodging
facilitators
and
rental
22


facilitators,
and
retailers
who
would
be
required

23


the
excise
taxes
if
the
excise
taxes
were
a
sales
and
use
tax

The
bill
defines
a
lodging
facilitator

and
motel
excise

to
the
automobile
rental
excise
27


tax,
to
include
certain
persons
who
facilitate
the
renting
of
28


the
taxable
items
by
directly
or
indirectly
performing
certain
29


acts
with
regard
to
the
rental
transaction.
The
bill
modifies
30


the
definition
of
“sales
price”

of
the
hotel
31


and
motel
excise
tax
and
“rental
price”
with
respect

_____


Iowa
college
or
university,
and
expands
an
exemption
for
the
1


renting
of
rooms
in
certain
religious
institutions
so
that
it
2


also
applies
to
the
state
and
local
hotel
and
motel
excise
tax.

Under
current
law,
that
exemption
only
applies
to
the
local

hotel
and
motel
excise
tax.
5


The
bill
modifies
the
definition
of
“lodging”
for
purposes
6


of
the
hotel
and
motel
excise
tax
to
include
a
cabin,
7


apartment,
or
residential
property.
The
bill
provides
that
it
8


is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
the
change
to
the
9


definition
of
“lodging”
is
a
conforming
amendment
consistent
10


with
current
state
law,
and
that
the
amendments
do
not
change
11


the
application
of
current
law
but
instead
reflect
current
law
12


both
before
and
after
the
enactment
of
these
changes.
The
13


changes
to
the
definition
of
“lodging”
take
effect
July
1,
14


2018.
15


Finally,
the
bill
provides
that
if
a
transaction
under
16


either
excise
tax
involves
both
a
lessor
and
a
lodging
17


facilitator
or
rental
facilitator,
as
applicable,
then
both
18


parties
will
be
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
applicable
19


tax,
and
further
provides
that
the
lodging
facilitator
or
20


rental
facilitator
shall
collect
the
entire
amount
of
tax
21


due
on
the
transaction,
regardless
of
the
amount
that
will
22


ultimately
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
lodging
facilitator
or
23


rental
facilitator,
or
any
other
person.
