  3  8 decedents that include a deferred estate or remainder interest
  3  9 and that have not, on or before July 1, 2018, received approval
  3 10 from the department of revenue to defer payment of tax pursuant
  3 11 to sections 450.44 through 450.49.
  3 12                           EXPLANATION
  3 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 15    This bill relates to the inheritance tax.  An estate
  3 16 subject to the inheritance tax may contain a deferred estate
  3 17 or remainder interest, which generally occurs when property is
  3 18 transferred to a person for a certain period of time, and then
  3 19 to a different person (remainderman) at the expiration of that
  3 20 time.  Under Iowa law, the inheritance tax accrues at the date
  3 21 of death of the decedent and is due on or before the last day of
  3 22 the ninth month following that date.  However, the payment of
  3 23 inheritance tax may be deferred for a remainderman until such
  3 24 time as the property actually passes to that person.
  3 25    When inheritance tax deferral is elected, Iowa law requires
  3 26 that a bond be given to secure the payment of the tax unless the
  3 27 estate contains real property and the automatic lien on such
  3 28 real property is sufficient to secure payment of the deferred
  3 29 tax.
  3 30    The bill provides that, in lieu of a bond, an estate
  3 31 containing personal property, real property, or a mix of
  3 32 both, may provide other security to secure payment of the
  3 33 deferred tax.  The bill provides that the other security must
  3 34 be satisfactory to the department of revenue (DOR).  The bill
  3 35 includes as examples of other security a bank or securities
  4  1 account with an irrevocable pay=on=death or transfer=on=death
  4  2 provision naming DOR as beneficiary, or an escrow agreement
  4  3 with DOR under which a private attorney will act as escrow
  4  4 agent and hold the escrow funds in the attorney's trust
  4  5 account.
  4  6    The bill requires that a description of the type and amount
  4  7 of the other security be added to the record of the deferred
  4  8 estate required to be kept under Code section 450.20.
  4  9    The bill applies to estates of decedents that include a
  4 10 deferred estate or remainder interest and that have not, on
  4 11 or before July 1, 2018, received approval from DOR to defer
  4 12 payment of the inheritance tax.
