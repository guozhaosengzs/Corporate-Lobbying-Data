  1  7 stability and growth.
  1  8    b.  Squandering human capital essential to the state's

  1 10    c.  Increasing demands for unemployment insurance benefits,

  1 14    d.  Imposing additional burdens on publicly funded health
  1 15 and welfare programs.
  1 16    e.  Decreasing income, property, and other tax revenues that

  4 11                           EXPLANATION
  4 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 14    This bill prohibits employment discrimination based on
  4 15 an individual's status as unemployed.  The bill defines
  4 16 "status as unemployed" as an individual who, at the time
  4 17 of application for employment or at the time of an alleged
  4 18 violation, does not have a job, is available for work, and
  4 19 is searching for work.  The Iowa civil rights commission is
  4 20 charged with administration of the bill via existing procedures
  4 21 for employment discrimination complaints.
  4 22    The bill prohibits an employer from engaging in certain
  4 23 unfair or discriminatory employment practices.  An employer is
  4 24 prohibited from publishing an advertisement or announcement
  4 25 for employment that includes any provision stating that an
  4 26 individual's status as unemployed disqualifies the individual
  4 27 for any employment opportunity or any provision stating that
  4 28 the employer will not consider or hire an individual for any
  4 29 employment opportunity based on that individual's status as
  4 30 unemployed.  An employer is prohibited from failing or refusing
  4 31 to consider for employment or failing or refusing to hire an
  4 32 individual because of the individual's status as unemployed.
  4 33 An employer is prohibited from directing or requesting that an
  4 34 employment agency take an individual's status as unemployed
  4 35 into account to disqualify an applicant for consideration,
  5  1 screening, or referral for employment.
  5  2    The bill also prohibits an employment agency from engaging
  5  3 in certain unfair or discriminatory employment practices.
  5  4 An employment agency is prohibited from publishing an
  5  5 advertisement or announcement for any vacancy in a job that
  5  6 includes any provision stating that an individual's status
  5  7 as unemployed disqualifies the individual for any employment
  5  8 opportunity or any provision stating that the employment agency
  5  9 or an employer will not consider or hire an individual for any
  5 10 employment opportunity based on that individual's status as
  5 11 unemployed.  An employment agency is prohibited from screening,
  5 12 or failing or refusing to consider, or failing or refusing to
  5 13 refer an individual for employment because of the individual's
  5 14 status as unemployed.  An employment agency is prohibited from
  5 15 limiting, segregating, or classifying an individual in any
  5 16 manner that would limit the individual's access to information
  5 17 about jobs, or consideration, screening, or referral for jobs
  5 18 solely because of the individual's status as unemployed.
  5 19    The bill provides that a prevailing complainant is entitled

  4 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 14    This bill prohibits employment discrimination based on
  4 15 an individual's status as unemployed.  The bill defines
  4 16 "status as unemployed" as an individual who, at the time
  4 17 of application for employment or at the time of an alleged
  4 18 violation, does not have a job, is available for work, and
  4 19 is searching for work.  The Iowa civil rights commission is
  4 20 charged with administration of the bill via existing procedures
  4 21 for employment discrimination complaints.
  4 22    The bill prohibits an employer from engaging in certain
  4 23 unfair or discriminatory employment practices.  An employer is
  4 24 prohibited from publishing an advertisement or announcement
  4 25 for employment that includes any provision stating that an
  4 26 individual's status as unemployed disqualifies the individual
  4 27 for any employment opportunity or any provision stating that
  4 28 the employer will not consider or hire an individual for any
  4 29 employment opportunity based on that individual's status as
  4 30 unemployed.  An employer is prohibited from failing or refusing
  4 31 to consider for employment or failing or refusing to hire an
  4 32 individual because of the individual's status as unemployed.
  4 33 An employer is prohibited from directing or requesting that an
  4 34 employment agency take an individual's status as unemployed
  4 35 into account to disqualify an applicant for consideration,
  5  1 screening, or referral for employment.
  5  2    The bill also prohibits an employment agency from engaging
  5  3 in certain unfair or discriminatory employment practices.
  5  4 An employment agency is prohibited from publishing an
  5  5 advertisement or announcement for any vacancy in a job that
  5  6 includes any provision stating that an individual's status
  5  7 as unemployed disqualifies the individual for any employment
  5  8 opportunity or any provision stating that the employment agency
  5  9 or an employer will not consider or hire an individual for any
  5 10 employment opportunity based on that individual's status as
  5 11 unemployed.  An employment agency is prohibited from screening,
  5 12 or failing or refusing to consider, or failing or refusing to
  5 13 refer an individual for employment because of the individual's
  5 14 status as unemployed.  An employment agency is prohibited from
  5 15 limiting, segregating, or classifying an individual in any
  5 16 manner that would limit the individual's access to information
  5 17 about jobs, or consideration, screening, or referral for jobs
  5 18 solely because of the individual's status as unemployed.
  5 19    The bill provides that a prevailing complainant is entitled
  5 20 to damages including but not limited to actual damages; court
  5 21 costs; reasonable attorney fees; for a violation relating to
  5 22 publication of an advertisement or announcement for employment,
  5 23 up to $1,000 for each day the violation occurs; and for
  5 24 any other violation, if wages, salary, employment benefits,
  5 25 or other compensation have not been denied or lost to the
  5 26 complainant, up to $5,000.
  5 27    The bill is not to be construed to preclude an employer
  5 28 or employment agency from considering an individual's
  5 29 employment history, or from examining the reasons underlying
  5 30 an individual's status as unemployed, in assessing an
  5 31 individual's ability to perform a job or in otherwise making
  5 32 employment decisions about that individual.  Such consideration
  5 33 or examination may include an assessment of whether an
  5 34 individual's employment history in a similar or related job
  5 35 for a period of time reasonably proximate to the time of
  6  1 consideration for new employment is job=related or consistent
  6  2 with business necessity in relation to that new employment.
