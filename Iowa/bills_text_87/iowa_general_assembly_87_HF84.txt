  4  9    This bill expands current law to allow any qualified parent
  4 10 to teach driver education to that parent's child. Current law
  4 11 allows a parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a student who
  4 12 is providing competent private instruction to that student to
  4 13 teach the student driver education, provided the person has a
  4 14 valid driver's license that permits unaccompanied driving and
  4 15 has a clear driving record for the previous two years.
  4 16    The requirements for a driver education course taught
  4 17 by a qualified parent are the same as the requirements
  4 18 currently applicable to a course taught by a "teaching parent".
  4 19 "Qualified parent" is defined to include a parent, guardian, or
  4 20 legal custodian of a student, provided the person has a valid
  4 21 driver's license that permits unaccompanied driving and has a
  4 22 clear driving record for the previous two years.
  4 23    The classroom instruction requirements for the alternative
  4 24 course of instruction are substantially the same as for an
  4 25 approved course of instruction offered by a public school
  4 26 district or private or commercial driver education school,
  4 27 with additional requirements for 40, rather than 20, hours
  4 28 of street or highway driving including night driving. The

  4 32 education courses approved for public or private schools. A
