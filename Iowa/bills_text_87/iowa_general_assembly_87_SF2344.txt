  5 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 28    This bill relates to public forums, freedom of expression,
  5 29 and freedom of association at community colleges and regents
  5 30 universities.
  5 31    DEFINITIONS.  The bill defines "benefit", "campus
  5 32 community", "outdoor areas of campus", "public institution of
  5 33 higher education", "student", and "student organization" for
  5 34 purposes of the new Code chapter established by the bill.
  5 35    POLICY ADOPTION.  The bill requires the boards governing
  6  1 the public postsecondary institutions to adopt a policy that
  6  2 includes statements describing the functions and roles of
  6  3 institutions with regard to knowledge; protected speech;
  6  4 the freedom to discuss within the bounds of the established
  6  5 principles of the first amendment to the United States
  6  6 Constitution; freedom to assemble and engage in spontaneous
  6  7 expressive activities subject to reasonable time, place,
  6  8 and manner restrictions; and public areas of campuses as

  6 11 noncommercial expressive activities including oral or written
  6 12 means to communicate ideas, including all forms of peaceful
  6 13 assembly, protests, speeches including by invited speakers,
  6 14 distribution of literature, and circulating petitions.  A

  6 22 organization any benefit or privilege available to any other
  6 23 student organization.  However, nothing in the bill shall be
  6 24 interpreted as limiting the right of student expression in a
  6 25 counter demonstration held on campus so long as the conduct
  6 26 at the counter demonstration is not unlawful and does not
  6 27 materially and substantially prohibit the free expression
  6 28 rights of others or disrupt the functioning of the institution.
  6 29    PUBLIC FORUMS ON CAMPUS == FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION.  The
  6 30 bill requires that the outdoor areas of campuses of public
  6 31 postsecondary institutions be deemed traditional public forums.
  6 32 The institutions may maintain and enforce reasonable time,
  6 33 place, and manner restrictions consistent with first amendment
  6 34 established principles.

  5 33 higher education", "student", and "student organization" for
  5 34 purposes of the new Code chapter established by the bill.
  5 35    POLICY ADOPTION.  The bill requires the boards governing
  6  1 the public postsecondary institutions to adopt a policy that
  6  2 includes statements describing the functions and roles of
  6  3 institutions with regard to knowledge; protected speech;
  6  4 the freedom to discuss within the bounds of the established
  6  5 principles of the first amendment to the United States
  6  6 Constitution; freedom to assemble and engage in spontaneous
  6  7 expressive activities subject to reasonable time, place,
  6  8 and manner restrictions; and public areas of campuses as
  6  9 traditional public forums.
  6 10    PROTECTED ACTIVITIES.  Protected activities include
  6 11 noncommercial expressive activities including oral or written
  6 12 means to communicate ideas, including all forms of peaceful
  6 13 assembly, protests, speeches including by invited speakers,
  6 14 distribution of literature, and circulating petitions.  A
  6 15 member of the campus community who wishes to engage in
  6 16 noncommercial expressive activity on campus shall be permitted
  6 17 to do so freely subject to reasonable time, place, and
  6 18 manner restrictions.  However, nothing in the bill shall be

  6 20 limiting, or restricting unprotected expression.
  6 21    A public postsecondary institution shall not deny a student
  6 22 organization any benefit or privilege available to any other

  6 24 interpreted as limiting the right of student expression in a
  6 25 counter demonstration held on campus so long as the conduct
  6 26 at the counter demonstration is not unlawful and does not
  6 27 materially and substantially prohibit the free expression
  6 28 rights of others or disrupt the functioning of the institution.

  7  7 However, nothing in the bill shall be interpreted to limit any
  7  8 other available remedies to a member of the campus community.
  7  9    STATE MANDATE == INAPPLICABILITY PROVISION.  The bill may
  7 10 include a state mandate as defined in Code section 25B.3.  The

  5 25                           EXPLANATION
  5 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 28    This bill relates to public forums, freedom of expression,
  5 29 and freedom of association at community colleges and regents
  5 30 universities.
  5 31    DEFINITIONS.  The bill defines "benefit", "campus
  5 32 community", "outdoor areas of campus", "public institution of
  5 33 higher education", "student", and "student organization" for
  5 34 purposes of the new Code chapter established by the bill.
  5 35    POLICY ADOPTION.  The bill requires the boards governing
  6  1 the public postsecondary institutions to adopt a policy that
  6  2 includes statements describing the functions and roles of
  6  3 institutions with regard to knowledge; protected speech;
  6  4 the freedom to discuss within the bounds of the established
  6  5 principles of the first amendment to the United States
  6  6 Constitution; freedom to assemble and engage in spontaneous
  6  7 expressive activities subject to reasonable time, place,
  6  8 and manner restrictions; and public areas of campuses as
  6  9 traditional public forums.
  6 10    PROTECTED ACTIVITIES.  Protected activities include
  6 11 noncommercial expressive activities including oral or written
  6 12 means to communicate ideas, including all forms of peaceful
  6 13 assembly, protests, speeches including by invited speakers,
  6 14 distribution of literature, and circulating petitions.  A
  6 15 member of the campus community who wishes to engage in
  6 16 noncommercial expressive activity on campus shall be permitted
  6 17 to do so freely subject to reasonable time, place, and
  6 18 manner restrictions.  However, nothing in the bill shall be
  6 19 interpreted as preventing the institutions from prohibiting,
  6 20 limiting, or restricting unprotected expression.
  6 21    A public postsecondary institution shall not deny a student
  6 22 organization any benefit or privilege available to any other
  6 23 student organization.  However, nothing in the bill shall be
  6 24 interpreted as limiting the right of student expression in a
  6 25 counter demonstration held on campus so long as the conduct
  6 26 at the counter demonstration is not unlawful and does not
  6 27 materially and substantially prohibit the free expression
  6 28 rights of others or disrupt the functioning of the institution.
  6 29    PUBLIC FORUMS ON CAMPUS == FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION.  The
  6 30 bill requires that the outdoor areas of campuses of public
  6 31 postsecondary institutions be deemed traditional public forums.
  6 32 The institutions may maintain and enforce reasonable time,
  6 33 place, and manner restrictions consistent with first amendment
  6 34 established principles.
  6 35    REMEDIES, STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AND IMMUNITY PROVISIONS.
  7  1  An aggrieved member of the campus community may bring an action
  7  2 against the institution responsible for a violation of the
  7  3 Code chapter and seek appropriate relief, and may assert such
  7  4 violation as a defense or counterclaim.
  7  5    Such person has one year after the day the cause of action
  7  6 accrues to bring a claim for violation of the Code chapter.
  7  7 However, nothing in the bill shall be interpreted to limit any
  7  8 other available remedies to a member of the campus community.
  7  9    STATE MANDATE == INAPPLICABILITY PROVISION.  The bill may
  7 10 include a state mandate as defined in Code section 25B.3.  The
  7 11 bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which
  7 12 would relieve a political subdivision from complying with a
  7 13 state mandate if funding for the cost of the state mandate is
  7 14 not provided or specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions
  7 15 are required to comply with any state mandate included in the
