  2  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  7    Under current law, a person is prohibited from operating a
  2  8 motor vehicle equipped with a front windshield, a side window
  2  9 to the immediate right or left of the driver, or a sidewing
  2 10 forward of and to the left or right of the driver which is
  2 11 excessively dark or reflective so that it is difficult for
  2 12 a person outside the motor vehicle to see into the motor
  2 13 vehicle through the windshield, window, or sidewing. Under
  2 14 rules adopted by the department of transportation (761 IAC
  2 15 450.7), "excessively dark or reflective" means the windshield,
  2 16 side window, or sidewing does not meet a minimum standard of
  2 17 transparency of 70 percent light transmittance.
  2 18    This bill prohibits a person from operating a motor vehicle
  2 19 equipped with a front windshield, a side window to the
  2 20 immediate right or left of the driver, or a sidewing forward
  2 21 of and to the left or right of the driver which does not
  2 22 meet a minimum standard of transparency of 35 percent light
  2 23 transmittance. The bill also strikes the provision requiring
  2 24 the department of transportation to adopt rules establishing a
  2 25 minimum measurable standard of transparency. A violation of
  2 26 this provision of the bill is punishable by a scheduled fine
  2 27 of $50.
  2 28    The bill also provides that if a peace officer stops a motor
  2 29 vehicle equipped with a side window to the immediate right or
  2 30 left of the driver which has a transparency of 70 percent light
  2 31 transmittance or less, the driver must lower the side window
  2 32 on the side of the officer's approach of the vehicle to the
  2 33 side window's lowest possible position prior to the completion
  2 34 of the officer's approach of the vehicle, and must keep the
  2 35 side window in the lowest possible position for the duration
  3  1 of the stop unless otherwise instructed by the officer. A
  3  2 violation of this provision of the bill is punishable by a
  3  3 scheduled fine of $20. However, if the violation is a person's
  3  4 first violation, and the person has not previously been issued
  3  5 a warning memorandum for a similar violation, the officer is
  3  6 required to issue a warning memorandum to the driver in lieu
  3  7 of a citation.
