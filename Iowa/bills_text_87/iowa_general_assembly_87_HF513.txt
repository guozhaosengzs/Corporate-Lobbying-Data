  4  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  3    This bill amends Code section 321.299 to require the driver
  4  4 of a vehicle overtaking a person riding a bicycle proceeding
  4  5 in the same direction on a roadway to pass to the left of the
  4  6 bicycle in an adjacent travel lane or on the opposite side of
  4  7 the roadway, and prohibits the driver from returning to the
  4  8 right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken
  4  9 bicycle in accordance with Code section 321.281. Code section
  4 10 321.281 prohibits a person operating a vehicle from steering
  4 11 the vehicle unreasonably close to or toward a person riding
  4 12 a bicycle on a highway. This provision of the bill does not
  4 13 apply if the bicycle is traveling on a paved shoulder or in a
  4 14 lane designated for the travel of bicycles.
  4 15    A violation of Code section 321.281 is punishable by a
  4 16 scheduled fine of $250 and a violation of Code section 321.299
  4 17 is punishable by a scheduled fine of $100. However, if a
  4 18 violation of Code section 321.299 causes a serious injury, a
  4 19 court could impose an additional fine of $500 and suspend the
  4 20 person's driver's license for not more than 90 days. If the
  4 21 violation causes a death, a court could impose an additional
  4 22 fine of $1,000 and suspend the person's driver's license for
  4 23 not more than 180 days.
  4 24    Under Code section 321.234, a person riding a bicycle on the
  4 25 highway is subject to the provisions of Code chapter 321 (motor
  4 26 vehicles and law of the road) and has all the rights and duties
  4 27 applicable to the driver of a vehicle. The bill specifies
  4 28 that under Code section 321.304 a vehicle is prohibited from
  4 29 overtaking and passing a bicycle when approaching the crest of
  4 30 a grade or upon a curve in the highway where the driver's view
  4 31 along the highway is obstructed for a distance of approximately
  4 32 700 feet; when approaching within 100 feet of any narrow
  4 33 bridge, viaduct, or tunnel; or when approaching within 100 feet
  4 34 of or traversing any intersection or railroad grade crossing.
  4 35 However, the bill provides that a vehicle may pass a bicycle
  5  1 where official signs are in place directing that traffic keep
  5  2 to the right or a distinctive center line or off=center line
  5  3 is marked, provided the vehicle complies with the current
  5  4 requirements for overtaking on the left.
  5  5    A violation of Code section 321.304 is punishable by a
  5  6 scheduled fine of $100. However, if the violation causes a
  5  7 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  5  8 and suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  5  9 days. If the violation causes a death, a court could impose
  5 10 an additional fine of $1,000 and suspend the person's driver's
  5 11 license for not more than 180 days.
  5 12    Current law requires a bicycle to have a front lighted lamp
  5 13 and either a rear lighted lamp or a rear reflector at any time
  5 14 from sunset to sunrise, and at such other times when conditions
  5 15 such as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide insufficient lighting
  5 16 to render clearly discernible persons and vehicles on the
  5 17 highway at a distance of 500 feet ahead.
  5 18    The bill instead requires that, from sunset to sunrise, a
  5 19 bicycle must be equipped with a lamp on the front exhibiting a
  5 20 steady or flashing white light visible from a distance of at
  5 21 least 300 feet to the front, and every bicycle or bicycle rider
  5 22 must be equipped with a lamp exhibiting a steady or flashing
  5 23 red light visible from a distance of 300 feet to the rear.
  5 24    The scheduled fine for a violation of this provision is $25.
  5 25 However, the bill provides that a citation issued for failure
  5 26 to have a front or rear lamp on a bicycle or on a bicycle rider
  5 27 must first provide for a 72=hour period within which the person
  5 28 charged with the violation can replace or repair the lamp. If
  5 29 the person complies with the directive to replace or repair the
  5 30 bicycle lamp, the citation must be expunged.

  5 15 such as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide insufficient lighting
  5 16 to render clearly discernible persons and vehicles on the
  5 17 highway at a distance of 500 feet ahead.
  5 18    The bill instead requires that, from sunset to sunrise, a
