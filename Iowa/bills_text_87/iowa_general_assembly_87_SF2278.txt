  7  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  7  9 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which part
  7 10 provides for the regulation of animal feeding operations where
  7 11 agricultural animals are maintained for at least 45 days in
  7 12 any 12=month period and includes open feedlots and confinement
  7 13 feeding operations (operations) including associated
  7 14 confinement feeding operation structures (structures), such
  7 15 as buildings or manure storage structures. The Code chapter
  7 16 is administered and enforced by the department of natural
  7 17 resources (DNR).  Generally, regulations vary based on the size
  7 18 of an operation measured by its animal unit capacity (AUC).
  7 19    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== RELATED CONFINEMENT FEEDING OPERATIONS.
  7 20  The bill provides that for purposes of administering and
  7 21 enforcing Code chapter 459, subchapter II, providing for
  7 22 air quality regulations and Code chapter 459, subchapter
  7 23 III, providing for water quality regulations, two or more
  7 24 operations are deemed to be a single operation if they are
  7 25 related.  The operations are related if a structure that is
  7 26 part of one operation is separated by less than 2,500 feet from
  7 27 a structure that is part of the other operation and certain
  7 28 alternative conditions apply. The first condition occurs
  7 29 if the confinement feeding operations utilize some common
  7 30 method of manure storage or common area or system for manure
  7 31 disposal. The second condition occurs when the confinement
  7 32 feeding operations utilize a common item or service such as a
  7 33 private road, private water well, utility connection, or other
  7 34 personal property described by DNR rule. The third condition
  7 35 occurs when the same person holds a legal or equitable interest
  8  1 in the real property where the operations are located.  If the
  8  2 person is a business entity, the business entity's interest is
  8  3 attributable to any person who owns an interest in the entity
  8  4 or who is an employee, manager, or officer of the entity.  A
  8  5 person's interest is also attributable to a relative (e.g.,
  8  6 spouse, child, or brother or sister).  A person's interest
  8  7 does not include the acquisition of property by a number of
  8  8 devices including by operation of law, an encumbrance taken as
  8  9 a security, or under contract with a government entity.
  8 10    BACKGROUND ==== CURRENT LAW ==== ADJACENCY.  For purposes of air
  8 11 quality regulation, two or more animal feeding operations under
  8 12 common ownership or management are deemed to be a single animal
  8 13 feeding operation if they are adjacent or utilize a common
  8 14 system for manure storage and are separated within a minimum
  8 15 distance from each other based on the size of the operation.
  8 16 For purposes of water quality regulation, two or more animal
  8 17 feeding operations under common ownership or management are
  8 18 deemed to be a single operation if they are adjacent or utilize
  8 19 a common area or system for manure disposal and are separated
  8 20 by another set of separation distances again based on the size
  8 21 of the operation.
  8 22    BACKGROUND ==== AUC.  AUC  refers to a measurement used to
  8 23 determine the maximum number of animal units that may be
  8 24 maintained as part of an animal feeding operation at any one
  8 25 time.  In calculating AUC, a special equivalency factor is
  8 26 assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  8 27    BACKGROUND ==== ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.
  8 28  Compliance with a statutory regulation under the Code chapter
  8 29 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section
  8 30 459.103). Code section 459.602 provides for civil penalties
  8 31 that may be assessed for violations of Code chapter 459,
  8 32 subchapter II (air quality regulations). A violator is subject
  8 33 to Code section 455B.109, which provides for the administrative
  8 34 assessment of civil penalties of up to $10,000. Code section
  8 35 459.603 provides for civil penalties that may be assessed for
  9  1 violations of Code chapter 459, subchapter III (water quality
  9  2 regulations).  A violator is subject to either Code section
  9  3 455B.109 providing for the administrative assessment of civil
  9  4 penalties or Code section 455B.191, which provides for a
  9  5 general civil penalty assessed judicially of up to $5,000.

  7  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  7  9 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which part
  7 10 provides for the regulation of animal feeding operations where
  7 11 agricultural animals are maintained for at least 45 days in
  7 12 any 12=month period and includes open feedlots and confinement
  7 13 feeding operations (operations) including associated
  7 14 confinement feeding operation structures (structures), such
  7 15 as buildings or manure storage structures. The Code chapter
  7 16 is administered and enforced by the department of natural
  7 17 resources (DNR).  Generally, regulations vary based on the size
  7 18 of an operation measured by its animal unit capacity (AUC).
  7 19    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== RELATED CONFINEMENT FEEDING OPERATIONS.
  7 20  The bill provides that for purposes of administering and
  7 21 enforcing Code chapter 459, subchapter II, providing for
  7 22 air quality regulations and Code chapter 459, subchapter
  7 23 III, providing for water quality regulations, two or more
  7 24 operations are deemed to be a single operation if they are
  7 25 related.  The operations are related if a structure that is
  7 26 part of one operation is separated by less than 2,500 feet from
  7 27 a structure that is part of the other operation and certain
  7 28 alternative conditions apply. The first condition occurs
  7 29 if the confinement feeding operations utilize some common
  7 30 method of manure storage or common area or system for manure
  7 31 disposal. The second condition occurs when the confinement
  7 32 feeding operations utilize a common item or service such as a
  7 33 private road, private water well, utility connection, or other
  7 34 personal property described by DNR rule. The third condition
  7 35 occurs when the same person holds a legal or equitable interest
  8  1 in the real property where the operations are located.  If the
  8  2 person is a business entity, the business entity's interest is
  8  3 attributable to any person who owns an interest in the entity
  8  4 or who is an employee, manager, or officer of the entity.  A
  8  5 person's interest is also attributable to a relative (e.g.,
  8  6 spouse, child, or brother or sister).  A person's interest
  8  7 does not include the acquisition of property by a number of
  8  8 devices including by operation of law, an encumbrance taken as
  8  9 a security, or under contract with a government entity.
  8 10    BACKGROUND ==== CURRENT LAW ==== ADJACENCY.  For purposes of air
  8 11 quality regulation, two or more animal feeding operations under
  8 12 common ownership or management are deemed to be a single animal
  8 13 feeding operation if they are adjacent or utilize a common
  8 14 system for manure storage and are separated within a minimum
  8 15 distance from each other based on the size of the operation.
  8 16 For purposes of water quality regulation, two or more animal
  8 17 feeding operations under common ownership or management are
  8 18 deemed to be a single operation if they are adjacent or utilize
  8 19 a common area or system for manure disposal and are separated
  8 20 by another set of separation distances again based on the size
  8 21 of the operation.
  8 22    BACKGROUND ==== AUC.  AUC  refers to a measurement used to
  8 23 determine the maximum number of animal units that may be
  8 24 maintained as part of an animal feeding operation at any one
  8 25 time.  In calculating AUC, a special equivalency factor is
  8 26 assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  8 27    BACKGROUND ==== ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.
  8 28  Compliance with a statutory regulation under the Code chapter
  8 29 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section
  8 30 459.103). Code section 459.602 provides for civil penalties
  8 31 that may be assessed for violations of Code chapter 459,
  8 32 subchapter II (air quality regulations). A violator is subject
  8 33 to Code section 455B.109, which provides for the administrative
  8 34 assessment of civil penalties of up to $10,000. Code section
  8 35 459.603 provides for civil penalties that may be assessed for
  9  1 violations of Code chapter 459, subchapter III (water quality
  9  2 regulations).  A violator is subject to either Code section
  9  3 455B.109 providing for the administrative assessment of civil
  9  4 penalties or Code section 455B.191, which provides for a
  9  5 general civil penalty assessed judicially of up to $5,000.

  8 13 feeding operation if they are adjacent or utilize a common
  8 14 system for manure storage and are separated within a minimum
  8 15 distance from each other based on the size of the operation.
  8 16 For purposes of water quality regulation, two or more animal
  8 17 feeding operations under common ownership or management are
  8 18 deemed to be a single operation if they are adjacent or utilize
  8 19 a common area or system for manure disposal and are separated
  8 20 by another set of separation distances again based on the size
  8 21 of the operation.
