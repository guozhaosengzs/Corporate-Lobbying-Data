  4 16 providing an individual income tax credit and other marriage
  4 17 license preferences for couples who complete qualified
  4 18 premarital counseling, and requiring certain information be
  4 19 provided upon filing a petition for dissolution.  The bill

  4 21 counseling that is attended by both parties of a prospective
  4 22 marriage, is at least four hours in duration, is facilitated
  4 23 by a licensed marital and family therapist (as defined in

  4 28 following issuance of a marriage license until such license
  4 29 becomes valid, except for exceptions provided under current
  4 30 law for cases of emergency or extraordinary circumstances
  4 31 as determined by a district court judge.  The bill also

  5  5 25 percent of the amount paid by a taxpayer during the tax
  5  6 year for qualified premarital counseling that results in a
  5  7 solemnized marriage between the parties to the prospective
  5  8 marriage, not to exceed $1,000 per married couple.  Amounts
  5  9 paid for premarital counseling are deemed to be paid on
  5 10 the date the marriage is solemnized.  The bill prohibits
  5 11 an individual from claiming the tax credit more than once.
  5 12 The tax credit is nonrefundable, and the excess may not be
  5 13 carried forward or backward to a different tax year.  The tax
  5 14 credit applies retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax years
  5 15 beginning on or after that date.
