  5 16 a security in this state unless it is registered with the
  5 17 division, exempt from registration, or a federal covered
  5 18 security regulated under federal law (Code section 502.301).
  5 19 The bill amends provisions that are closely connected to
  5 20 two federal statutes: the "Securities Act of 1933" and the
  5 21 "Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (for citations, see Code
  5 22 section 502.103) as administered by the federal securities and
  5 23 exchange commission (SEC).  The SEC works in close cooperation
  5 24 with several private entities including the financial industry
  5 25 regulatory authority (FINRA).
  5 26    BLUE SKY LAW ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill strikes
  5 27 references to the national association of securities
  5 28 dealers (NASD) which was a self=regulatory organization of
  5 29 the securities industry responsible for the operation and
  5 30 regulation of the NASDAQ stock market and over=the=counter
  5 31 markets.   It has been succeeded by FINRA, a not=for=profit
  5 32 organization recognized by federal statute to regulate
  5 33 broker=dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase
  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  5 22 section 502.103) as administered by the federal securities and

  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  5  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  8    GENERAL.  This bill provides for the regulation of a number
  5  9 of noninsurance business transactions and associated entities
  5 10 by the insurance division (division) of the department of
  5 11 commerce.
  5 12    BLUE SKY LAW ==== GENERAL.  The amended provisions include
  5 13 sections in the "Iowa Uniform Securities Act" which is
  5 14 sometimes referred to as the "Blue Sky Law (Code chapter
  5 15 502). A person is prohibited from offering to sell or selling
  5 16 a security in this state unless it is registered with the
  5 17 division, exempt from registration, or a federal covered
  5 18 security regulated under federal law (Code section 502.301).
  5 19 The bill amends provisions that are closely connected to
  5 20 two federal statutes: the "Securities Act of 1933" and the
  5 21 "Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (for citations, see Code
  5 22 section 502.103) as administered by the federal securities and
  5 23 exchange commission (SEC).  The SEC works in close cooperation
  5 24 with several private entities including the financial industry
  5 25 regulatory authority (FINRA).
  5 26    BLUE SKY LAW ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill strikes
  5 27 references to the national association of securities
  5 28 dealers (NASD) which was a self=regulatory organization of
  5 29 the securities industry responsible for the operation and
  5 30 regulation of the NASDAQ stock market and over=the=counter
  5 31 markets.   It has been succeeded by FINRA, a not=for=profit
  5 32 organization recognized by federal statute to regulate
  5 33 broker=dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase
  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed

  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member

  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either

  5  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  8    GENERAL.  This bill provides for the regulation of a number
  5  9 of noninsurance business transactions and associated entities
  5 10 by the insurance division (division) of the department of
  5 11 commerce.
  5 12    BLUE SKY LAW ==== GENERAL.  The amended provisions include
  5 13 sections in the "Iowa Uniform Securities Act" which is
  5 14 sometimes referred to as the "Blue Sky Law (Code chapter
  5 15 502). A person is prohibited from offering to sell or selling
  5 16 a security in this state unless it is registered with the
  5 17 division, exempt from registration, or a federal covered
  5 18 security regulated under federal law (Code section 502.301).
  5 19 The bill amends provisions that are closely connected to
  5 20 two federal statutes: the "Securities Act of 1933" and the
  5 21 "Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (for citations, see Code
  5 22 section 502.103) as administered by the federal securities and
  5 23 exchange commission (SEC).  The SEC works in close cooperation
  5 24 with several private entities including the financial industry
  5 25 regulatory authority (FINRA).
  5 26    BLUE SKY LAW ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill strikes
  5 27 references to the national association of securities
  5 28 dealers (NASD) which was a self=regulatory organization of
  5 29 the securities industry responsible for the operation and
  5 30 regulation of the NASDAQ stock market and over=the=counter
  5 31 markets.   It has been succeeded by FINRA, a not=for=profit
  5 32 organization recognized by federal statute to regulate
  5 33 broker=dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase
  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  5 19 The bill amends provisions that are closely connected to
  5 20 two federal statutes: the "Securities Act of 1933" and the

  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member

  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred

  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as

  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's

  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery

  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  5  9 of noninsurance business transactions and associated entities
  5 10 by the insurance division (division) of the department of
  5 11 commerce.
  5 12    BLUE SKY LAW ==== GENERAL.  The amended provisions include
  5 13 sections in the "Iowa Uniform Securities Act" which is
  5 14 sometimes referred to as the "Blue Sky Law (Code chapter
  5 15 502). A person is prohibited from offering to sell or selling
  5 16 a security in this state unless it is registered with the
  5 17 division, exempt from registration, or a federal covered
  5 18 security regulated under federal law (Code section 502.301).
  5 19 The bill amends provisions that are closely connected to
  5 20 two federal statutes: the "Securities Act of 1933" and the
  5 21 "Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (for citations, see Code
  5 22 section 502.103) as administered by the federal securities and

  5 24 with several private entities including the financial industry
  5 25 regulatory authority (FINRA).

  5 28 dealers (NASD) which was a self=regulatory organization of
  5 29 the securities industry responsible for the operation and
  5 30 regulation of the NASDAQ stock market and over=the=counter
  5 31 markets.   It has been succeeded by FINRA, a not=for=profit
  5 32 organization recognized by federal statute to regulate
  5 33 broker=dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase
  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or

  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to

  5 19 The bill amends provisions that are closely connected to
  5 20 two federal statutes: the "Securities Act of 1933" and the
  5 21 "Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (for citations, see Code
  5 22 section 502.103) as administered by the federal securities and
  5 23 exchange commission (SEC).  The SEC works in close cooperation
  5 24 with several private entities including the financial industry
  5 25 regulatory authority (FINRA).
  5 26    BLUE SKY LAW ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill strikes
  5 27 references to the national association of securities
  5 28 dealers (NASD) which was a self=regulatory organization of
  5 29 the securities industry responsible for the operation and
  5 30 regulation of the NASDAQ stock market and over=the=counter
  5 31 markets.   It has been succeeded by FINRA, a not=for=profit
  5 32 organization recognized by federal statute to regulate
  5 33 broker=dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase
  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code

  5 16 a security in this state unless it is registered with the

  5 25 regulatory authority (FINRA).

  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal

  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill

  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the

  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which

  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section

  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in

  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the

  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
  8  7 section 523A.102).

  5 21 "Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (for citations, see Code
  5 22 section 502.103) as administered by the federal securities and

  5 24 with several private entities including the financial industry
  5 25 regulatory authority (FINRA).
  5 26    BLUE SKY LAW ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill strikes

  5 30 regulation of the NASDAQ stock market and over=the=counter
  5 31 markets.   It has been succeeded by FINRA, a not=for=profit
  5 32 organization recognized by federal statute to regulate
  5 33 broker=dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase
  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.

  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.

  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident

  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code

  5 31 markets.   It has been succeeded by FINRA, a not=for=profit
  5 32 organization recognized by federal statute to regulate
  5 33 broker=dealers engaged in transactions involving the purchase
  5 34 and sale of securities for their own account or for the account
  5 35 of others.
  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.

  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the

  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as

  6  1 BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING ==== BILL'S
  6  2 PROVISIONS.  The bill amends  provisions (Code section
  6  3 502.202(24)) that currently exempt intrastate crowdfunding from
  6  4 certain Blue Sky Law requirements, including the registration
  6  5 of securities (Code sections 502.301 and 502.306) and the
  6  6 filing of sales and advertising literature (Code section
  6  7 502.504).
  6  8    The bill revises the definition of "intermediary" to include
  6  9 a business entity that satisfies two requirements: (1) be
  6 10 registered with the SEC as a funding portal and (2) be a member
  6 11 of FINRA (17 C.F.R. {227.400).  Under federal law, a funding
  6 12 portal cannot offer investment advice or recommendations or
  6 13 solicit purchases or sales of securities, or handle investor
  6 14 assets (17 U.S.C. {78c(a)(80)).
  6 15    Currently, in Iowa, an intermediary is limited to either
  6 16 a broker=dealer registered with the division (Code section
  6 17 502.401) or a business entity, such as a corporation,
  6 18 qualifying as an "Iowa crowdfunding portal" which means
  6 19 it: (1) is registered with the division, (2) is organized
  6 20 under state law, (3) is engaged exclusively in intrastate
  6 21 crowdfunding offers and sales of exempt securities in this
  6 22 state through an internet site, and (4) does not operate or
  6 23 facilitate a secondary market in securities.  The bill provides
  6 24 that an Iowa crowdfunding portal would no longer be required to
  6 25 be organized or authorized to do business in this state or be
  6 26 engaged in crowdfunding exclusively in this state. Finally,
  6 27 the bill increases the aggregate amount of securities that
  6 28 could be sold to investors by an issuer acting through an
  6 29 intermediary during the 12 months prior to the date of offer or
  6 30 sale from $1 million to $5 million.
  6 31    BLUE SKY LAW ==== INTRASTATE CROWDFUNDING.  "Crowdfunding"
  6 32 refers to the practice of raising capital to finance ventures
  6 33 (e.g., start=ups and early stage companies) by attracting
  6 34 investments generally from small contributors purchasing an
  6 35 equity position (e.g., the purchase of stock) via the internet.
  7  1 "Intrastate crowdfunding" refers to a securities transaction
  7  2 that is: (1) available for purchase only by an Iowa resident
  7  3 or business entity having its principal place of business in
  7  4 this state and (2) made via an intermediary's internet site.
  7  5 The bill requires the business entity maintain its principal
  7  6 place of business in this state.
  7  7    BLUE SKY LAW ==== REGULATION OF NOTICE FILINGS AND FEES.  The
  7  8 bill updates a statutory citation that provides that the SEC
  7  9 form "D", a notice of an exempt offering (17 C.F.R. {239.500),
  7 10 and an associated fee are required to be filed with the
  7 11 division.  The federal "National Securities Markets Improvement
  7 12 Act of 1996" (Pub. L. No. 104=290) amended the Securities
  7 13 Act of 1933, by creating a class of securities referred
  7 14 to as "covered securities" which when sold by a licensed
  7 15 broker=dealer is no longer subject to state registration  but
  7 16 may be subject to notice filings at the state level so long as
  7 17 the state's requirements are substantially the same as those in
  7 18 effect on September 1, 1996 (15 U.S.C. {77r).
  7 19    VIATICAL SETTLEMENTS ==== CHANGE IN ORGANIZATION.  The bill
  7 20 amends a provision referring to circumstances in which a
  7 21 person may be immune from liability from an offense involving
  7 22 a fraudulent viatical settlement act, if the person acting in
  7 23 good faith sends or receives information from NASD.  The bill
  7 24 changes that organization to FINRA.
  7 25    AUDIT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CEMETERY
  7 26 AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES.  The bill amends the
  7 27 "Iowa Cemetery and Funeral Merchandise and Funeral Services
  7 28 Act" (Code chapter 523A) which regulates business entities and
  7 29 sales agents offering to provide cemetery merchandise, funeral
  7 30 merchandise, or funeral services upon an individual's death.
  7 31 The bill provides that when a purchase agreement is acquired as
  7 32 part of the sale of a business or the assets of a business, a
  7 33 buyer would no longer be required to comply with the statute's
  7 34 audit requirements. A requirement for an audit performed by a
  7 35 certified public accountant is replaced by a simpler process
  8  1 of review referred to as an agreed=upon procedures engagement
  8  2 and accompanying report.  In addition, the division may waive
  8  3 this requirement based on good cause (Code section 523A.207).
  8  4 A purchase agreement refers to an agreement to furnish cemetery
  8  5 merchandise, funeral merchandise, and funeral services which
  8  6 may occur more than 120 days following an initial payment (Code
