  2 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 26    This bill relates to the temporary delegation of parental
  2 27 authority by the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a
  2 28 child.
  2 29    The bill provides that a parent, guardian, or legal
  2 30 custodian of a child, by a properly executed power of attorney,
  2 31 may delegate to another person any powers regarding the care
  2 32 or custody of the child except the power to consent to the
  2 33 child's marriage, the power to consent to the child's adoption,
  2 34 the power to consent to the performance or inducement of an
  2 35 abortion on or for the child, and the power to consent to the
  3  1 termination of the parental rights of a parent of the child. A
  3  2 power of attorney executed under the bill must be signed by all
  3  3 parents, guardians, and legal custodians of a child and must
  3  4 be properly acknowledged by a notary. A parent, guardian, or
  3  5 legal custodian shall have the authority to revoke or terminate
  3  6 a power of attorney created under the bill at any time.
  3  7    A power of attorney created under the bill shall be for a
  3  8 period of time not to exceed 90 days. The parent, guardian, or
  3  9 legal custodian of the child is required to execute a new power
  3 10 of attorney for an additional period of 90 days, and the power
  3 11 of attorney cannot exceed 180 days. If the parent, guardian,
  3 12 or legal custodian revokes or terminates the power of attorney,
  3 13 the child shall be returned to the care and custody of the
  3 14 parent, guardian, or legal custodian within 24 hours of the
  3 15 date of the revocation or termination.
  3 16    An agent (person granted authority to act for a parent,
  3 17 guardian, or legal custodian under a power of attorney
  3 18 created in the bill) is required to exercise parental or legal
  3 19 authority on a continuous basis without compensation for the
  3 20 duration of the power of attorney and shall not be considered
  3 21 to be a foster parent subject to licensure by the department
  3 22 of human services pursuant to Code chapter 237 (child foster
  3 23 care facilities).  A power of attorney executed under the bill
  3 24 by a parent, guardian, or legal custodian shall not constitute
  3 25 abandonment, abuse, or neglect of the child under Code chapter
  3 26 232 by the parent, guardian, or legal custodian unless the
  3 27 parent, guardian, or legal custodian fails to take custody of
  3 28 the child or to execute a subsequent power of attorney upon the
  3 29 expiration of the power of attorney.
  3 30    The bill provides power of attorney execution requirements
  3 31 and requires the department of human services, in consultation
  3 32 with the judicial branch, to develop forms for carrying out the
  3 33 provisions of the bill.
