  2 16 takes place on or after the effective date of this Act.
  2 17                           EXPLANATION
  2 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 20    This bill provides employee leave by providing for time off
  2 21 and vacation leave. The bill relates to payments for accrued
  2 22 vacation time and for accrued paid time off for all employees
  2 23 who are terminated or suspended.
  2 24    Current law requires an employer to pay accrued vacation pay
  2 25 to a terminated or suspended employee only if the employer has
  2 26 a policy, procedure, or contract that requires the employer to
  2 27 do so.
  2 28    The bill defines "paid time off" as a benefit allowing an
  2 29 employee to take time off from work with pay without regard to
  2 30 the reason the employee chooses to take the time off. "Paid
  2 31 time off" is also added to the definition of "wages".
  2 32    The bill provides that if an employee is suspended or
  2 33 terminated, upon request the employer must pay all earned
  2 34 wages, now including paid time off, by the next regular payday.
  2 35 The bill provides for an employee who earned paid time off
  3  1 while employed but did not earn vacation, that the employer may
  3  2 reduce the pay for the accrued paid time off by one=third. For
  3  3 an employee who earned both vacation and paid time off while
  3  4 employed, the employer is not required to make payment for the
  3  5 paid time off.
  3  6    An employer shall not adopt a policy or practice to deny
  3  7 payment for accrued vacation or accrued paid time off upon the
  3  8 suspension or termination of an employee unless the employee's
  3  9 employment ended due to misconduct. Misconduct is defined in
  3 10 the department of workforce development's administrative rules.
  3 11    The bill provides for the calculation and payment of an
  3 12 employee's accrued paid time off or vacation if the employee
  3 13 is suspended or terminated. The amount of such pay owed to an
  3 14 employee is the amount of pay equal to the accrued vacation or
  3 15 paid time off as if the employee began taking the vacation or
  3 16 paid time off the day the suspension or termination took place,
  3 17 unless otherwise provided in the bill.
  3 18    Unpaid wages or expenses, along with liquidated damages,
  3 19 court costs, and attorney's fees, may be recovered by the
  3 20 employee or the commissioner by civil action under Code chapter
  3 21 91A.  An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is also subject
  3 22 to a civil penalty of not more than $500 per pay period for each
  3 23 violation.
  3 24    The bill takes effect upon enactment. The bill is made
  3 25 applicable only to the suspension or termination of an
  3 26 employee's employment that occurs on or after that date.

  2 21 and vacation leave. The bill relates to payments for accrued
  2 22 vacation time and for accrued paid time off for all employees
  2 23 who are terminated or suspended.
  2 24    Current law requires an employer to pay accrued vacation pay
  2 25 to a terminated or suspended employee only if the employer has
  2 26 a policy, procedure, or contract that requires the employer to
  2 27 do so.
  2 28    The bill defines "paid time off" as a benefit allowing an
  2 29 employee to take time off from work with pay without regard to
  2 30 the reason the employee chooses to take the time off. "Paid
  2 31 time off" is also added to the definition of "wages".
  2 32    The bill provides that if an employee is suspended or
  2 33 terminated, upon request the employer must pay all earned
  2 34 wages, now including paid time off, by the next regular payday.
  2 35 The bill provides for an employee who earned paid time off
  3  1 while employed but did not earn vacation, that the employer may
  3  2 reduce the pay for the accrued paid time off by one=third. For
  3  3 an employee who earned both vacation and paid time off while
  3  4 employed, the employer is not required to make payment for the
  3  5 paid time off.
  3  6    An employer shall not adopt a policy or practice to deny
  3  7 payment for accrued vacation or accrued paid time off upon the
  3  8 suspension or termination of an employee unless the employee's
  3  9 employment ended due to misconduct. Misconduct is defined in
  3 10 the department of workforce development's administrative rules.
  3 11    The bill provides for the calculation and payment of an
  3 12 employee's accrued paid time off or vacation if the employee
  3 13 is suspended or terminated. The amount of such pay owed to an
  3 14 employee is the amount of pay equal to the accrued vacation or
  3 15 paid time off as if the employee began taking the vacation or
  3 16 paid time off the day the suspension or termination took place,
  3 17 unless otherwise provided in the bill.
  3 18    Unpaid wages or expenses, along with liquidated damages,
  3 19 court costs, and attorney's fees, may be recovered by the
  3 20 employee or the commissioner by civil action under Code chapter
  3 21 91A.  An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is also subject
  3 22 to a civil penalty of not more than $500 per pay period for each
  3 23 violation.
  3 24    The bill takes effect upon enactment. The bill is made
  3 25 applicable only to the suspension or termination of an
  3 26 employee's employment that occurs on or after that date.

  2  9 had not been suspended or terminated and had begun taking the
  2 10 total amount of accrued paid time off or accrued vacation on
  2 11 the date the suspension or termination occurred.
  2 12    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2 13 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 14    Sec. 5.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies only to the
  2 15 suspension or termination of an employee's employment that
  2 16 takes place on or after the effective date of this Act.
  2 17                           EXPLANATION
  2 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 20    This bill provides employee leave by providing for time off
  2 21 and vacation leave. The bill relates to payments for accrued
  2 22 vacation time and for accrued paid time off for all employees
  2 23 who are terminated or suspended.
  2 24    Current law requires an employer to pay accrued vacation pay
  2 25 to a terminated or suspended employee only if the employer has
  2 26 a policy, procedure, or contract that requires the employer to
  2 27 do so.
  2 28    The bill defines "paid time off" as a benefit allowing an
  2 29 employee to take time off from work with pay without regard to
  2 30 the reason the employee chooses to take the time off. "Paid
  2 31 time off" is also added to the definition of "wages".
  2 32    The bill provides that if an employee is suspended or
  2 33 terminated, upon request the employer must pay all earned
  2 34 wages, now including paid time off, by the next regular payday.
  2 35 The bill provides for an employee who earned paid time off
  3  1 while employed but did not earn vacation, that the employer may
  3  2 reduce the pay for the accrued paid time off by one=third. For
  3  3 an employee who earned both vacation and paid time off while
  3  4 employed, the employer is not required to make payment for the
  3  5 paid time off.
  3  6    An employer shall not adopt a policy or practice to deny
  3  7 payment for accrued vacation or accrued paid time off upon the
  3  8 suspension or termination of an employee unless the employee's
  3  9 employment ended due to misconduct. Misconduct is defined in
  3 10 the department of workforce development's administrative rules.
  3 11    The bill provides for the calculation and payment of an
  3 12 employee's accrued paid time off or vacation if the employee
  3 13 is suspended or terminated. The amount of such pay owed to an
  3 14 employee is the amount of pay equal to the accrued vacation or
  3 15 paid time off as if the employee began taking the vacation or
  3 16 paid time off the day the suspension or termination took place,
  3 17 unless otherwise provided in the bill.
  3 18    Unpaid wages or expenses, along with liquidated damages,
  3 19 court costs, and attorney's fees, may be recovered by the
  3 20 employee or the commissioner by civil action under Code chapter
  3 21 91A.  An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is also subject
  3 22 to a civil penalty of not more than $500 per pay period for each
  3 23 violation.
  3 24    The bill takes effect upon enactment. The bill is made
  3 25 applicable only to the suspension or termination of an
  3 26 employee's employment that occurs on or after that date.

  2 21 and vacation leave. The bill relates to payments for accrued
  2 22 vacation time and for accrued paid time off for all employees
  2 23 who are terminated or suspended.
  2 24    Current law requires an employer to pay accrued vacation pay
  2 25 to a terminated or suspended employee only if the employer has
  2 26 a policy, procedure, or contract that requires the employer to
  2 27 do so.
  2 28    The bill defines "paid time off" as a benefit allowing an
  2 29 employee to take time off from work with pay without regard to
  2 30 the reason the employee chooses to take the time off. "Paid
  2 31 time off" is also added to the definition of "wages".
  2 32    The bill provides that if an employee is suspended or
  2 33 terminated, upon request the employer must pay all earned
  2 34 wages, now including paid time off, by the next regular payday.
  2 35 The bill provides for an employee who earned paid time off
  3  1 while employed but did not earn vacation, that the employer may
  3  2 reduce the pay for the accrued paid time off by one=third. For
  3  3 an employee who earned both vacation and paid time off while
  3  4 employed, the employer is not required to make payment for the
  3  5 paid time off.
  3  6    An employer shall not adopt a policy or practice to deny
  3  7 payment for accrued vacation or accrued paid time off upon the
  3  8 suspension or termination of an employee unless the employee's
  3  9 employment ended due to misconduct. Misconduct is defined in
  3 10 the department of workforce development's administrative rules.
  3 11    The bill provides for the calculation and payment of an
  3 12 employee's accrued paid time off or vacation if the employee
  3 13 is suspended or terminated. The amount of such pay owed to an
  3 14 employee is the amount of pay equal to the accrued vacation or
  3 15 paid time off as if the employee began taking the vacation or
  3 16 paid time off the day the suspension or termination took place,
  3 17 unless otherwise provided in the bill.
  3 18    Unpaid wages or expenses, along with liquidated damages,
  3 19 court costs, and attorney's fees, may be recovered by the
  3 20 employee or the commissioner by civil action under Code chapter
  3 21 91A.  An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is also subject
