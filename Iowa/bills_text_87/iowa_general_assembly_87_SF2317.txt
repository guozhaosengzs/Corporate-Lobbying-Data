 11 27  11 27  11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill modifies various provisions relating to the
 11 32 utilities division of the department of commerce.
 11 33    Current law requires the Iowa utilities board to appoint an
 11 34 executive secretary, whose salary is set by the board and who
 11 35 takes the same oath as board members. The bill requires the
 12  1 board to appoint a chief operating officer (COO) instead of
 12  2 an executive secretary. The bill specifies that the role of
 12  3 the COO is to manage the operations of the utilities division
 12  4 as directed by the board. The bill provides that the board
 12  5 shall set the salary of the COO within the limits of the
 12  6 law and authorizes the board to employ additional personnel
 12  7 as necessary. The bill replaces references to "executive
 12  8 secretary" with "COO" in the Code.
 12  9    Current law disqualifies a person owning any bonds, stock,
 12 10 or property in any railroad company from holding office in the
 12 11 utilities board. The bill removes this disqualification.
 12 12    The bill removes or replaces references in the Code to
 12 13 repealed Code section 476.29, which required telecommunications
 12 14 service providers to obtain certification from the board.
 12 15    The bill removes the requirement for the board to provide
 12 16 the general assembly with a report on certain energy efficiency
 12 17 planning efforts to be completed by January 1, 1998.
 12 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(21), which provides
 12 19 cost recovery for certain rate=regulated public utilities for
 12 20 undertaking analyses of and preparations for the possible
 12 21 construction of nuclear generating facilities in the state.
 12 22    Current law allows the board to allocate and charge expenses
 12 23 attributable to its duties to a person bringing a proceeding
 12 24 before the board or participating in matters before the board.
 12 25 The bill allows the board to also allocate and charge expenses
 12 26 attributable to its duties to a person subject to inspection
 12 27 by the board.
 12 28    Current law requires the board to specify certain ratemaking
 12 29 principles that will apply to certain electric generating and
 12 30 transmission facilities. In doing so the board must find
 12 31 that a public utility has demonstrated to the board, through
 12 32 a competitive bidding process under rules adopted by the
 12 33 board, that its facility or lease is reasonable. The bill
 12 34 removes the requirement that a public utility demonstrate the
 12 35 reasonableness of its facility or lease through a competitive
 13  1 bidding process under rules adopted by the board.
 13  2    The bill requires telecommunications services providers
 13  3 offering communications service telephone numbers to retail
 13  4 customers in the state to register annually with the board.
 13  5 An applicant must complete an application for registration
 13  6 on a form provided by the board, which shall include contact
 13  7 information, the approximate number of service lines provided
 13  8 in the state, and any other information deemed necessary by
 13  9 the board. The board must issue a nonexclusive acknowledgment
 13 10 of compliance within five business days of the receipt of a
 13 11 completed application of registration. Such acknowledgment
 13 12 shall authorize the registrant to obtain telephone numbers,
 13 13 interconnect with other telecommunications providers, cross
 13 14 railroad rights=of=way, and provide telecommunications services
 13 15 in the state. An acknowledgment is transferrable by filing a
 13 16 new or updated registration board. A registrant shall submit
 13 17 corrections to the registration form within a reasonable time
 13 18 after a change in circumstances if such information would be
 13 19 required to be reported in an application. Failure to file and
 13 20 maintain an annual registration subjects a telecommunications
 13 21 services provider to a civil penalty under Code section 476.51.
 13 22    Current law requires the board to impose an annual
 13 23 assessment upon all telecommunications carriers in the state
 13 24 to fund dual party relay service programs, with the assessment
 13 25 rate depending on the type of telecommunications carrier. The
 13 26 bill applies the same assessment rate to all telecommunications
 13 27 carriers providing service in the state, including but not
 13 28 limited to wireless, wireline, and alternative operator service
 13 29 providers, at a rate of three cents for each communications
 13 30 service telephone number provided in the state.
 13 31    Current law requires pipeline companies doing business in
 13 32 the state to pay the board an annual inspection fee of 50
 13 33 cents for each mile of pipeline located in the state. The
 13 34 bill removes this set fee and instead allows the board to
 13 35 charge pipeline companies with annual inspection fees that are
 14  1 directly attributable to the costs of conducting inspections.
 14  2    Current law allows a landowner to petition the county
 14  3 board of supervisors to appoint a compensation commission to
 14  4 determine damages arising from the construction of certain
 14  5 pipelines if the landowner and pipeline company are unable to
 14  6 agree on damages. If the compensation commission's assessment
 14  7 of damages exceeds 110 percent of the pipeline company's final
 14  8 offer prior to the assessment, the pipeline company must pay
 14  9 all costs of the assessment, including costs incurred by the
 14 10 landowner; if the assessment does not exceed 110 percent of
 14 11 the pipeline company's final offer prior to the assessment,
 14 12 the landowner must pay the costs incurred by the pipeline
 14 13 company. The bill removes provisions requiring a landowner to
 14 14 pay the costs incurred by a pipeline company if a compensation
 14 15 commission's assessment of damages does not exceed 110 percent
 14 16 of the pipeline company's final offer prior to such assessment.

 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill modifies various provisions relating to the
 11 32 utilities division of the department of commerce.
 11 33    Current law requires the Iowa utilities board to appoint an
 11 34 executive secretary, whose salary is set by the board and who
 11 35 takes the same oath as board members. The bill requires the
 12  1 board to appoint a chief operating officer (COO) instead of
 12  2 an executive secretary. The bill specifies that the role of
 12  3 the COO is to manage the operations of the utilities division
 12  4 as directed by the board. The bill provides that the board
 12  5 shall set the salary of the COO within the limits of the
 12  6 law and authorizes the board to employ additional personnel
 12  7 as necessary. The bill replaces references to "executive
 12  8 secretary" with "COO" in the Code.
 12  9    Current law disqualifies a person owning any bonds, stock,
 12 10 or property in any railroad company from holding office in the
 12 11 utilities board. The bill removes this disqualification.
 12 12    The bill removes or replaces references in the Code to
 12 13 repealed Code section 476.29, which required telecommunications
 12 14 service providers to obtain certification from the board.
 12 15    The bill removes the requirement for the board to provide
 12 16 the general assembly with a report on certain energy efficiency
 12 17 planning efforts to be completed by January 1, 1998.
 12 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(21), which provides
 12 19 cost recovery for certain rate=regulated public utilities for
 12 20 undertaking analyses of and preparations for the possible
 12 21 construction of nuclear generating facilities in the state.
 12 22    Current law allows the board to allocate and charge expenses
 12 23 attributable to its duties to a person bringing a proceeding
 12 24 before the board or participating in matters before the board.
 12 25 The bill allows the board to also allocate and charge expenses
 12 26 attributable to its duties to a person subject to inspection
 12 27 by the board.
 12 28    Current law requires the board to specify certain ratemaking
 12 29 principles that will apply to certain electric generating and
 12 30 transmission facilities. In doing so the board must find
 12 31 that a public utility has demonstrated to the board, through
 12 32 a competitive bidding process under rules adopted by the
 12 33 board, that its facility or lease is reasonable. The bill
 12 34 removes the requirement that a public utility demonstrate the
 12 35 reasonableness of its facility or lease through a competitive
 13  1 bidding process under rules adopted by the board.
 13  2    The bill requires telecommunications services providers
 13  3 offering communications service telephone numbers to retail
 13  4 customers in the state to register annually with the board.
 13  5 An applicant must complete an application for registration
 13  6 on a form provided by the board, which shall include contact
 13  7 information, the approximate number of service lines provided
 13  8 in the state, and any other information deemed necessary by
 13  9 the board. The board must issue a nonexclusive acknowledgment
 13 10 of compliance within five business days of the receipt of a
 13 11 completed application of registration. Such acknowledgment
 13 12 shall authorize the registrant to obtain telephone numbers,
 13 13 interconnect with other telecommunications providers, cross
 13 14 railroad rights=of=way, and provide telecommunications services
 13 15 in the state. An acknowledgment is transferrable by filing a
 13 16 new or updated registration board. A registrant shall submit
 13 17 corrections to the registration form within a reasonable time
 13 18 after a change in circumstances if such information would be
 13 19 required to be reported in an application. Failure to file and
 13 20 maintain an annual registration subjects a telecommunications
 13 21 services provider to a civil penalty under Code section 476.51.
 13 22    Current law requires the board to impose an annual
 13 23 assessment upon all telecommunications carriers in the state
 13 24 to fund dual party relay service programs, with the assessment
 13 25 rate depending on the type of telecommunications carrier. The
 13 26 bill applies the same assessment rate to all telecommunications
 13 27 carriers providing service in the state, including but not
 13 28 limited to wireless, wireline, and alternative operator service
 13 29 providers, at a rate of three cents for each communications
 13 30 service telephone number provided in the state.
 13 31    Current law requires pipeline companies doing business in
 13 32 the state to pay the board an annual inspection fee of 50
 13 33 cents for each mile of pipeline located in the state. The
 13 34 bill removes this set fee and instead allows the board to
 13 35 charge pipeline companies with annual inspection fees that are
 14  1 directly attributable to the costs of conducting inspections.
 14  2    Current law allows a landowner to petition the county
 14  3 board of supervisors to appoint a compensation commission to
 14  4 determine damages arising from the construction of certain
 14  5 pipelines if the landowner and pipeline company are unable to
 14  6 agree on damages. If the compensation commission's assessment
 14  7 of damages exceeds 110 percent of the pipeline company's final
 14  8 offer prior to the assessment, the pipeline company must pay
 14  9 all costs of the assessment, including costs incurred by the
 14 10 landowner; if the assessment does not exceed 110 percent of
 14 11 the pipeline company's final offer prior to the assessment,
 14 12 the landowner must pay the costs incurred by the pipeline
 14 13 company. The bill removes provisions requiring a landowner to
 14 14 pay the costs incurred by a pipeline company if a compensation
 14 15 commission's assessment of damages does not exceed 110 percent
 14 16 of the pipeline company's final offer prior to such assessment.
