  3  4    2.  The agricultural assets transfer agreement shall

  3 25    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  3 26    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  3 27 under the agricultural assets transfer tax credit program. The
  3 28 tax credit is allowed against the taxes imposed in chapter 422,
  3 29 division II, as provided in section 422.11M, and in chapter
  3 30 422, division III, as provided in section 422.33, to facilitate
  3 31 the transfer of agricultural assets from a participating
  3 32 taxpayer to a participating beginning farmer as described in
  3 33 section 16.78.
  3 34    2.  An individual may claim an agricultural assets transfer
  3 35 tax credit under this section of a partnership, limited
  4  1 liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust electing
  4  2 to have income taxed directly to the individual. The amount
  4  3 claimed by the individual shall be based upon the pro rata
  4  4 share of the individual's earnings from the partnership,
  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit
  4 10 shall be computed as follows:
  4 11    (1)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the taxpayer
  4 12 may claim a tax credit equal to five percent of the gross
  4 13 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for each tax
  4 14 year that the tax credit is allowed.
  4 15    (2)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer may
  4 16 claim a tax credit equal to six percent of the gross amount
  4 17 paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for the first year
  4 18 that the tax credit is allowed and five percent of the gross
  4 19 amount paid to the taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that
  4 20 the taxpayer is allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer
  4 21 may only claim five percent of the gross amount paid to the
  4 22 taxpayer under a renewed agreement or a new agreement executed
  4 23 by the same parties.
  4 24    b.  For an agreement made on a commodity share basis, the tax
  4 25 credit shall be computed as follows:
  4 26    (1)  (a)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the
  4 27 taxpayer may claim a tax credit equal to fifteen percent of the
  4 28 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or livestock sold under
  4 29 the agreement.
  4 30    (b)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer
  4 31 may claim a tax credit equal to sixteen percent of the amount
  4 32 paid to the taxpayer from crops or livestock sold under the
  4 33 agreement for the first tax year that the taxpayer is allowed
  4 34 the tax credit and fifteen percent of the amount paid to the
  4 35 taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that the taxpayer is
  5  1 allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer may only claim
  5  2 fifteen percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer from crops
  5  3 or livestock sold for any tax year under a renewed agreement or
  5  4 a new agreement executed by the same parties.
  5  5    (2)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), the authority may
  5  6 elect an alternative method to compute a tax credit for an
  5  7 agreement based on a crop share basis. The alternative method
  5  8 shall utilize a formula which uses data compiled by the United
  5  9 States department of agriculture. The formula shall calculate
  5 10 the amount of the tax credit by multiplying the average per
  5 11 bushel yield for the same type of grain as produced under the
  5 12 lease in the same county where the leased agricultural land is
  5 13 located by a per bushel state price established for such type
  5 14 of grain harvested the previous fall.
  5 15    4.  a.  The authority must review and approve an application
  5 16 for an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as provided by
  5 17 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
  5 18 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
  5 19 authority may require that the parties to an agreement provide
  5 20 additional information as determined relevant by the authority.
  5 21 The authority shall review an application which includes the
  5 22 renewal of an agreement to determine that the parties to the
  5 23 renewed agreement meet the same qualifications as required for
  5 24 an original application.
  5 25    b.  After approving an application, the authority shall issue
  5 26 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to a
  5 27 taxpayer as provided in section 16.81, regardless of whether
  5 28 the taxpayer has previously been allowed a tax credit under
  5 29 this section or section 175.37 as it existed prior to January
  5 30 1, 2015.
  5 31    c.  The authority shall not approve an application or issue
  5 32 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to
  5 33 a taxpayer for an amount in excess of twenty=five thousand
  5 34 dollars. In addition, the authority shall not approve an
  5 35 application or issue an agricultural assets transfer tax credit
  6  1 certificate to a taxpayer if any of the following applies:
  6  2    (1)  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
  6  3 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
  6  4 authority.
  6  5    (2)  The taxpayer is any of the following:
  6  6    (a)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
  6  7 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,

  4  3 claimed by the individual shall be based upon the pro rata
  4  4 share of the individual's earnings from the partnership,
  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required

  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit

  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until
  6 22 depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be
  6 23 carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the

  3 29 division II, as provided in section 422.11M, and in chapter
  3 30 422, division III, as provided in section 422.33, to facilitate
  3 31 the transfer of agricultural assets from a participating
  3 32 taxpayer to a participating beginning farmer as described in
  3 33 section 16.78.
  3 34    2.  An individual may claim an agricultural assets transfer
  3 35 tax credit under this section of a partnership, limited
  4  1 liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust electing
  4  2 to have income taxed directly to the individual. The amount
  4  3 claimed by the individual shall be based upon the pro rata
  4  4 share of the individual's earnings from the partnership,
  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit
  4 10 shall be computed as follows:
  4 11    (1)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the taxpayer
  4 12 may claim a tax credit equal to five percent of the gross
  4 13 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for each tax
  4 14 year that the tax credit is allowed.
  4 15    (2)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer may
  4 16 claim a tax credit equal to six percent of the gross amount
  4 17 paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for the first year
  4 18 that the tax credit is allowed and five percent of the gross
  4 19 amount paid to the taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that
  4 20 the taxpayer is allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer
  4 21 may only claim five percent of the gross amount paid to the
  4 22 taxpayer under a renewed agreement or a new agreement executed
  4 23 by the same parties.
  4 24    b.  For an agreement made on a commodity share basis, the tax
  4 25 credit shall be computed as follows:
  4 26    (1)  (a)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the
  4 27 taxpayer may claim a tax credit equal to fifteen percent of the
  4 28 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or livestock sold under

  4 30    (b)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer
  4 31 may claim a tax credit equal to sixteen percent of the amount
  4 32 paid to the taxpayer from crops or livestock sold under the
  4 33 agreement for the first tax year that the taxpayer is allowed
  4 34 the tax credit and fifteen percent of the amount paid to the
  4 35 taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that the taxpayer is
  5  1 allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer may only claim
  5  2 fifteen percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer from crops
  5  3 or livestock sold for any tax year under a renewed agreement or
  5  4 a new agreement executed by the same parties.
  5  5    (2)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), the authority may
  5  6 elect an alternative method to compute a tax credit for an
  5  7 agreement based on a crop share basis. The alternative method
  5  8 shall utilize a formula which uses data compiled by the United
  5  9 States department of agriculture. The formula shall calculate
  5 10 the amount of the tax credit by multiplying the average per
  5 11 bushel yield for the same type of grain as produced under the
  5 12 lease in the same county where the leased agricultural land is
  5 13 located by a per bushel state price established for such type
  5 14 of grain harvested the previous fall.
  5 15    4.  a.  The authority must review and approve an application

  5 26 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to a
  5 27 taxpayer as provided in section 16.81, regardless of whether
  5 28 the taxpayer has previously been allowed a tax credit under
  5 29 this section or section 175.37 as it existed prior to January
  5 30 1, 2015.
  5 31    c.  The authority shall not approve an application or issue

  6 13 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by

  6 16 a rate that is substantially higher or lower than the market
  6 17 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
  6 18 the same community, as determined by the authority.
  6 19    5.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit in excess
  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until
  6 22 depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be
  6 23 carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the
  6 24 taxpayer redeems the tax credit. A tax credit shall not be
  6 25 transferable to any other person other than the taxpayer's
  6 26 estate or trust upon the taxpayer's death.
  6 27    6.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
  6 28 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
  6 29 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify

  6 33 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue

  7  2 agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate under a
  7  3 new agreement for the same agricultural assets as provided in
  7  4 this section for any remaining tax years for which a tax credit
  7  5 certificate was not issued.
  7  6    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at
  7  7 fault for the termination, the agricultural assets transfer
  7  8 tax credit that had been allowed for that tax year shall be
  7  9 disallowed and the amount shall be considered a tax payment
  7 10 due. If a taxpayer does not immediately notify the authority
  7 11 of the termination, the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed
  7 12 at fault for the termination.

  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.

  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until

  4  3 claimed by the individual shall be based upon the pro rata
  4  4 share of the individual's earnings from the partnership,
  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit
  4 10 shall be computed as follows:
  4 11    (1)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the taxpayer

  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be

  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be

  3 34    2.  An individual may claim an agricultural assets transfer
  3 35 tax credit under this section of a partnership, limited
  4  1 liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust electing

  4  3 claimed by the individual shall be based upon the pro rata
  4  4 share of the individual's earnings from the partnership,
  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit
  4 10 shall be computed as follows:
  4 11    (1)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the taxpayer

  4 18 that the tax credit is allowed and five percent of the gross
  4 19 amount paid to the taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that
  4 20 the taxpayer is allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer

  5 11 bushel yield for the same type of grain as produced under the
  5 12 lease in the same county where the leased agricultural land is
  5 13 located by a per bushel state price established for such type
  5 14 of grain harvested the previous fall.

  5 31    c.  The authority shall not approve an application or issue

  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until
  6 22 depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be

  3 35 tax credit under this section of a partnership, limited
  4  1 liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust electing
  4  2 to have income taxed directly to the individual. The amount
  4  3 claimed by the individual shall be based upon the pro rata
  4  4 share of the individual's earnings from the partnership,
  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit
  4 10 shall be computed as follows:
  4 11    (1)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the taxpayer
  4 12 may claim a tax credit equal to five percent of the gross
  4 13 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for each tax
  4 14 year that the tax credit is allowed.
  4 15    (2)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer may
  4 16 claim a tax credit equal to six percent of the gross amount
  4 17 paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for the first year
  4 18 that the tax credit is allowed and five percent of the gross
  4 19 amount paid to the taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that
  4 20 the taxpayer is allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer
  4 21 may only claim five percent of the gross amount paid to the
  4 22 taxpayer under a renewed agreement or a new agreement executed
  4 23 by the same parties.
  4 24    b.  For an agreement made on a commodity share basis, the tax
  4 25 credit shall be computed as follows:
  4 26    (1)  (a)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the

  4 30    (b)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer
  4 31 may claim a tax credit equal to sixteen percent of the amount
  4 32 paid to the taxpayer from crops or livestock sold under the

  4 34 the tax credit and fifteen percent of the amount paid to the
  4 35 taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that the taxpayer is
  5  1 allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer may only claim
  5  2 fifteen percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer from crops
  5  3 or livestock sold for any tax year under a renewed agreement or
  5  4 a new agreement executed by the same parties.
  5  5    (2)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (1), the authority may
  5  6 elect an alternative method to compute a tax credit for an
  5  7 agreement based on a crop share basis. The alternative method
  5  8 shall utilize a formula which uses data compiled by the United
  5  9 States department of agriculture. The formula shall calculate
  5 10 the amount of the tax credit by multiplying the average per
  5 11 bushel yield for the same type of grain as produced under the
  5 12 lease in the same county where the leased agricultural land is
  5 13 located by a per bushel state price established for such type
  5 14 of grain harvested the previous fall.
  5 15    4.  a.  The authority must review and approve an application
  5 16 for an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as provided by
  5 17 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include

  5 21 The authority shall review an application which includes the
  5 22 renewal of an agreement to determine that the parties to the
  5 23 renewed agreement meet the same qualifications as required for
  5 24 an original application.
  5 25    b.  After approving an application, the authority shall issue
  5 26 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to a
  5 27 taxpayer as provided in section 16.81, regardless of whether
  5 28 the taxpayer has previously been allowed a tax credit under
  5 29 this section or section 175.37 as it existed prior to January
  5 30 1, 2015.
  5 31    c.  The authority shall not approve an application or issue
  5 32 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to

  6  3 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
  6  4 authority.
  6  5    (2)  The taxpayer is any of the following:
  6  6    (a)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
  6  7 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,

  6 10 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
  6 11 department or the attorney general.
  6 12    (b)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
  6 13 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
  6 14 the department of natural resources under chapter 459.
  6 15    (3)  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
  6 16 a rate that is substantially higher or lower than the market
  6 17 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
  6 18 the same community, as determined by the authority.
  6 19    5.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit in excess
  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until
  6 22 depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be
  6 23 carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the

  6 25 transferable to any other person other than the taxpayer's
  6 26 estate or trust upon the taxpayer's death.
  6 27    6.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
  6 28 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
  6 29 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify
  6 30 the authority of the termination. Any prior properly claimed
  6 31 agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be allowed.
  6 32    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
  6 33 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue
  6 34 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to

  7  1 application. The taxpayer may apply for and be issued another
  7  2 agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate under a
  7  3 new agreement for the same agricultural assets as provided in
  7  4 this section for any remaining tax years for which a tax credit
  7  5 certificate was not issued.
  7  6    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at
  7  7 fault for the termination, the agricultural assets transfer
  7  8 tax credit that had been allowed for that tax year shall be
  7  9 disallowed and the amount shall be considered a tax payment
  7 10 due. If a taxpayer does not immediately notify the authority
  7 11 of the termination, the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed
  7 12 at fault for the termination.

  5  7 agreement based on a crop share basis. The alternative method
  5  8 shall utilize a formula which uses data compiled by the United

  5 11 bushel yield for the same type of grain as produced under the
  5 12 lease in the same county where the leased agricultural land is
  5 13 located by a per bushel state price established for such type
  5 14 of grain harvested the previous fall.
  5 15    4.  a.  The authority must review and approve an application
  5 16 for an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as provided by
  5 17 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include

  5 20 additional information as determined relevant by the authority.
  5 21 The authority shall review an application which includes the
  5 22 renewal of an agreement to determine that the parties to the
  5 23 renewed agreement meet the same qualifications as required for
  5 24 an original application.
  5 25    b.  After approving an application, the authority shall issue
  5 26 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to a
  5 27 taxpayer as provided in section 16.81, regardless of whether
  5 28 the taxpayer has previously been allowed a tax credit under
  5 29 this section or section 175.37 as it existed prior to January
  5 30 1, 2015.
  5 31    c.  The authority shall not approve an application or issue

  6  3 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
  6  4 authority.
  6  5    (2)  The taxpayer is any of the following:
  6  6    (a)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
  6  7 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,

  6  9 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
  6 10 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
  6 11 department or the attorney general.
  6 12    (b)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
  6 13 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
  6 14 the department of natural resources under chapter 459.
  6 15    (3)  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
  6 16 a rate that is substantially higher or lower than the market
  6 17 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
  6 18 the same community, as determined by the authority.
  6 19    5.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit in excess
  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until
  6 22 depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be
  6 23 carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the
  6 24 taxpayer redeems the tax credit. A tax credit shall not be
  6 25 transferable to any other person other than the taxpayer's
  6 26 estate or trust upon the taxpayer's death.
  6 27    6.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
  6 28 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
  6 29 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify
  6 30 the authority of the termination. Any prior properly claimed
  6 31 agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be allowed.
  6 32    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
  6 33 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue
  6 34 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to
  6 35 the taxpayer for a subsequent tax year based on the approved
  7  1 application. The taxpayer may apply for and be issued another
  7  2 agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate under a
  7  3 new agreement for the same agricultural assets as provided in
  7  4 this section for any remaining tax years for which a tax credit
  7  5 certificate was not issued.
  7  6    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at
  7  7 fault for the termination, the agricultural assets transfer
  7  8 tax credit that had been allowed for that tax year shall be
  7  9 disallowed and the amount shall be considered a tax payment
  7 10 due. If a taxpayer does not immediately notify the authority
  7 11 of the termination, the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed
  7 12 at fault for the termination.

  4  4 share of the individual's earnings from the partnership,
  4  5 limited liability company, S corporation, estate, or trust.
  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit
  4 10 shall be computed as follows:

  4 12 may claim a tax credit equal to five percent of the gross
  4 13 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for each tax
  4 14 year that the tax credit is allowed.
  4 15    (2)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer may
  4 16 claim a tax credit equal to six percent of the gross amount
  4 17 paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for the first year
  4 18 that the tax credit is allowed and five percent of the gross
  4 19 amount paid to the taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that
  4 20 the taxpayer is allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer
  4 21 may only claim five percent of the gross amount paid to the
  4 22 taxpayer under a renewed agreement or a new agreement executed
  4 23 by the same parties.
  4 24    b.  For an agreement made on a commodity share basis, the tax

  7  8 tax credit that had been allowed for that tax year shall be
  7  9 disallowed and the amount shall be considered a tax payment

  4  6    3.  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit shall be
  4  7 based on an agricultural assets transfer agreement as required
  4  8 in section 16.79.
  4  9    a.  For an agreement made on a cash basis, the tax credit
  4 10 shall be computed as follows:
  4 11    (1)  If the beginning farmer is not a veteran, the taxpayer
  4 12 may claim a tax credit equal to five percent of the gross
  4 13 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for each tax
  4 14 year that the tax credit is allowed.
  4 15    (2)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer may
  4 16 claim a tax credit equal to six percent of the gross amount
  4 17 paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for the first year
  4 18 that the tax credit is allowed and five percent of the gross
  4 19 amount paid to the taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that
  4 20 the taxpayer is allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer

  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until
  6 22 depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be
  6 23 carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the

  6 22 depleted, whichever is earlier. A tax credit shall not be
  6 23 carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the

  6 19    5.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit in excess
  6 20 of the taxpayer's liability for the tax year may be credited
  6 21 to the tax liability for the following ten tax years or until

  6 23 carried back to a tax year prior to the tax year in which the

  6 33 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue
  6 34 an agricultural assets transfer tax credit certificate to

  4 13 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agreement for each tax
  4 14 year that the tax credit is allowed.
  4 15    (2)  If the beginning farmer is a veteran, the taxpayer may

  4 18 that the tax credit is allowed and five percent of the gross
  4 19 amount paid to the taxpayer for each subsequent tax year that
  4 20 the taxpayer is allowed the tax credit. However, the taxpayer

  4 23 by the same parties.
  4 24    b.  For an agreement made on a commodity share basis, the tax
  4 25 credit shall be computed as follows:

  5  7 agreement based on a crop share basis. The alternative method
  5  8 shall utilize a formula which uses data compiled by the United

  5 10 the amount of the tax credit by multiplying the average per
  5 11 bushel yield for the same type of grain as produced under the

  8 15 striking the subparagraph and inserting in lieu thereof the
  8 16 following:
  8 17    (1)  The agricultural assets transfer tax credit as provided
  8 18 in section 16.80.
  8 19    Sec. 13.  Section 16.1, subsection 38, as amended by this
  8 20 Act, is amended by striking the subsection.
  8 21    Sec. 14.  Section 16.80, as amended by this Act, is amended
  8 22 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  8 23 following:
  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided
  8 29 in section 422.33, to facilitate the transfer of agricultural
  8 30 assets from a taxpayer to a beginning farmer.
  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the
  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.

 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,

  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 20 Act, is amended by striking the subsection.
  8 21    Sec. 14.  Section 16.80, as amended by this Act, is amended
  8 22 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  8 23 following:
  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided
  8 29 in section 422.33, to facilitate the transfer of agricultural
  8 30 assets from a taxpayer to a beginning farmer.
  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the

  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or

  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve

 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.

 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided

  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the

  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire

  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority

 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit

 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and

 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 20 Act, is amended by striking the subsection.
  8 21    Sec. 14.  Section 16.80, as amended by this Act, is amended
  8 22 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  8 23 following:
  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided
  8 29 in section 422.33, to facilitate the transfer of agricultural
  8 30 assets from a taxpayer to a beginning farmer.
  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the
  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an
 12 18 agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in
 12 22 lieu thereof the following:
 12 23    21.  The taxes imposed under this division shall be reduced
 12 24 by an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 25 section 16.80.
 12 26    Sec. 17.  REPEAL.  Sections 16.77, 16.78, 16.79, and 16.81,
 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but

  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the

  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior

 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.

 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended

 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a

  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a

 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this

 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a

  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section

  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an

 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.

 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the

 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax

 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a

  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided
  8 29 in section 422.33, to facilitate the transfer of agricultural
  8 30 assets from a taxpayer to a beginning farmer.
  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the
  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section

  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person

 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed

 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in
 12 22 lieu thereof the following:

 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 21    Sec. 14.  Section 16.80, as amended by this Act, is amended
  8 22 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  8 23 following:
  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided
  8 29 in section 422.33, to facilitate the transfer of agricultural
  8 30 assets from a taxpayer to a beginning farmer.
  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the
  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but

  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 24    16.80  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit ==== agreement.
  8 25    1.  An agricultural assets transfer tax credit is allowed
  8 26 under this section. The tax credit is allowed against the
  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided
  8 29 in section 422.33, to facilitate the transfer of agricultural
  8 30 assets from a taxpayer to a beginning farmer.
  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the
  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 27 taxes imposed in chapter 422, division II, as provided in
  8 28 section 422.11M, and in chapter 422, division III, as provided
  8 29 in section 422.33, to facilitate the transfer of agricultural
  8 30 assets from a taxpayer to a beginning farmer.
  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the
  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a

  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,

  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,

  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.

  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.

  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is

 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority

 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets

 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a

  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 31    2.  In order to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
  8 32 must meet qualifications established by rules adopted by the
  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not

  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  8 33 authority. At a minimum, the taxpayer must comply with all of
  8 34 the following:
  8 35    a.  Be a person who may acquire or otherwise obtain or lease
  9  1 agricultural land in this state pursuant to chapter 9H or 9I.
  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire

  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically

 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.

  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.

 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.

 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,

  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets

  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the

  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  2 However, the taxpayer must not be a person who may acquire
  9  3 or otherwise obtain or lease agricultural land exclusively
  9  4 because of an exception provided in one of those chapters or in
  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 33 transfer agreement.

 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve

 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 14 following:

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  5 a provision of another chapter of this Code including but not
  9  6 limited to chapter 10, 10D, or 501, or section 15E.207.
  9  7    b.  Execute an agricultural assets transfer agreement with a
  9  8 beginning farmer as provided in this section.
  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the

 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9  9    3.  An individual may claim a tax credit under this section
  9 10 of a partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 11 estate, or trust electing to have income taxed directly to
  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.
       LSB 2617HZ (4) 87

  9 12 the individual. The amount claimed by the individual shall
  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with

 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

  9 13 be based upon the pro rata share of the individual's earnings
  9 14 from the partnership, limited liability company, S corporation,
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more

 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.

 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.
       LSB 2617HZ (4) 87
       da/rj
  9 15 estate, or trust.
  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an
 12 18 agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in
 12 22 lieu thereof the following:
 12 23    21.  The taxes imposed under this division shall be reduced
 12 24 by an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under

 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 16    4.  The tax credit is allowed only for agricultural assets
  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in

 12 23    21.  The taxes imposed under this division shall be reduced
 12 24 by an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 25 section 16.80.
 12 26    Sec. 17.  REPEAL.  Sections 16.77, 16.78, 16.79, and 16.81,
 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 17 that are subject to an agricultural assets transfer agreement.
  9 18 The agreement shall provide for the lease of agricultural land
  9 19 including any improvements and may provide for the rental of
  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a

  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but

 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of

  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 20 agricultural equipment as defined in section 322F.1.
  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an
 12 18 agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in
 12 22 lieu thereof the following:
 12 23    21.  The taxes imposed under this division shall be reduced
 12 24 by an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 25 section 16.80.
 12 26    Sec. 17.  REPEAL.  Sections 16.77, 16.78, 16.79, and 16.81,
 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 21    a.  The agreement may be made on a cash basis or on a
  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 22 commodity share basis which includes a share of the crops or
  9 23 livestock produced on the agricultural land. The agreement
  9 24 must be in writing.
  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more

  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the

 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an
 12 18 agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 25    b.  The agreement shall be for at least two years, but
  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in
 12 22 lieu thereof the following:
 12 23    21.  The taxes imposed under this division shall be reduced
 12 24 by an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 25 section 16.80.
 12 26    Sec. 17.  REPEAL.  Sections 16.77, 16.78, 16.79, and 16.81,
 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 26 not more than five years. The agreement or that part of
  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 27 the agreement providing for the lease may be renewed by the
  9 28 beginning farmer for a term of at least two years, but not more
  9 29 than five years. An agreement does not include a lease or the
  9 30 rental of equipment intended as a security.
  9 31    5.  The tax credit shall be calculated based on the gross
  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an
 12 18 agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in
 12 22 lieu thereof the following:
 12 23    21.  The taxes imposed under this division shall be reduced
 12 24 by an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 25 section 16.80.
 12 26    Sec. 17.  REPEAL.  Sections 16.77, 16.78, 16.79, and 16.81,
 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 32 amount paid to the taxpayer under the agricultural assets
  9 33 transfer agreement.
  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year

 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding

 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this

 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the

 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.

 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve

 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

  9 34    a.  Except as provided in paragraph "b", the tax credit shall
  9 35 equal five percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer under the
 10  1 agreement.
 10  2    b.  The tax credit shall equal fifteen percent of the
 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express

 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but

 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.

 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to

 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority

 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:

 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:

 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by

 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a

 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured

 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced

 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and

 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10  3 amount paid to the taxpayer from crops or animals sold under
 10  4 an agreement in which the payment is exclusively made from the
 10  5 sale of crops or animals.
 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an

 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:

 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.

 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars

 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:

 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.

 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.

 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a

 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured

 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the

 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars

 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10  6    6.  In order to qualify as a beginning farmer, a person
 10  7 must be eligible to receive financial assistance under section
 10  8 16.75.
 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18

 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10  9    7.  A tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's liability
 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 10 for the tax year may be credited to the tax liability for
 10 11 the following ten tax years or until depleted, whichever is
 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two

 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year

 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity

 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and

 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming

 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 12 earlier. A tax credit shall not be carried back to a tax year
 10 13 prior to the tax year in which the taxpayer redeems the tax
 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements

 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 10 14 credit. A tax credit shall not be transferable to any other
 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:

 12 27 as enacted by this Act, are repealed.
 12 28    Sec. 18.  REPEAL.  Any intervening provision effective prior
 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
 12 34    1.  Except as provided in subsection 2, this division of this
 12 35 Act takes effect January 1, 2023.
 13  1    2.  The section of this division of this Act that relates to
 13  2 an intervening provision takes effect upon enactment.
 13  3    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
 13  4 to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 15 person other than the taxpayer's estate or trust upon the
 10 16 taxpayer's death.
 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by

 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and

 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements

 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new

 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the

 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:

 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.

 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by

 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.

 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to

 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 17    8.  A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit under this
 10 18 section unless a tax credit certificate issued by the authority
 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 19 is included with the taxpayer's tax return for the tax year for
 10 20 which the tax credit is claimed. The authority must review
 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express

 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not

 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 21 and approve an application for a tax credit as provided by
 10 22 rules adopted by the authority. The application must include
 10 23 a copy of the agricultural assets transfer agreement. The
 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the

 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault

 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not

 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 24 authority may approve an application and issue a tax credit
 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 25 certificate to a taxpayer who has previously been allowed a
 10 26 tax credit under this section. The authority may require
 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax
 10 30 credit which includes the renewal of an agricultural assets
 10 31 transfer agreement to determine that the parties to the renewed
 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced

 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two

 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning

 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative

 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent

 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 10 27 that the parties to an agricultural assets transfer agreement
 10 28 provide additional information as determined relevant by the
 10 29 authority. The authority shall review an application for a tax

 10 32 agreement meet the same qualifications as required for an
 10 33 original application. However, the authority shall not approve
 10 34 an application or issue a certificate to a taxpayer if any of
 10 35 the following applies:
 11  1    a.  The taxpayer is at fault for terminating a prior
 11  2 agricultural assets transfer agreement as determined by the
 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code

 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year

 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease

 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the

 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any

 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this

 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,

 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars

 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,

 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance

 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets

 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the

 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according

 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18

 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the

 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of

 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the

 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11  3 authority.
 11  4    b.  The taxpayer is any of the following:
 11  5    (1)  A party to a pending administrative or judicial action,
 11  6 including a contested case proceeding under chapter 17A,
 11  7 relating to an alleged violation involving an animal feeding
 11  8 operation as regulated by the department of natural resources,
 11  9 regardless of whether the pending action is brought by the
 11 10 department or the attorney general.
 11 11    (2)  Classified as a habitual violator for a violation of
 11 12 state law involving an animal feeding operation as regulated by
 11 13 the department of natural resources.
 11 14    c.  The beginning farmer is responsible for managing or
 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an
 12 18 agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under
 12 19 section 16.80.
 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in
 12 22 lieu thereof the following:
 12 23    21.  The taxes imposed under this division shall be reduced
 12 24 by an agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the

 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this

 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised

 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning

 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and

 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of

 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according

 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 15 maintaining agricultural land and other agricultural assets
 11 16 that are greater than necessary to adequately support a
 11 17 beginning farmer as determined by the authority according to
 11 18 rules which shall be adopted by the authority.
 11 19    d.  The agricultural assets are being leased or rented at
 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised

 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars

 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 20 a rate which is substantially higher or lower than the market
 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured

 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,

 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 21 rate for similar agricultural assets leased or rented within
 11 22 the same community, as determined by the authority.
 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may

 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 23    9.  A taxpayer or the beginning farmer may terminate an
 11 24 agricultural assets transfer agreement as provided in the
 11 25 agreement or by law. The taxpayer must immediately notify the
 11 26 authority of the termination.
 11 27    a.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is not
 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.

 12 29 to January 1, 2023, that amends a section as enacted in another
 12 30 division of this Act, and repealed in this division of this Act
 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.
 12 33    Sec. 19.  EFFECTIVE DATE.

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was

 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year

 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18

 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 28 at fault for the termination, the authority shall not issue a
 11 29 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer for a subsequent tax
 11 30 year based on the approved application. Any prior tax credit
 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements

 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling

 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 11 31 is allowed as provided in this section. The taxpayer may
 11 32 apply for and be issued another tax credit certificate for the
 11 33 same agricultural assets as provided in this section for any
 11 34 remaining tax years for which a certificate was not issued.
 11 35    b.  If the authority determines that the taxpayer is at fault
 12  1 for the termination, any prior tax credit allowed under this
 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and
 12  4 payable to the department of revenue. If a taxpayer does
 12  5 not immediately notify the authority of the termination,
 12  6 the taxpayer shall be conclusively deemed at fault for the
 12  7 termination.
 12  8    10.  The amount of tax credit certificates that may be issued
 12  9 pursuant to this section shall not exceed six million dollars
 12 10 in any fiscal year. The authority shall issue the tax credit
 12 11 certificates on a first=come, first=served basis.
 12 12    Sec. 15.  Section 422.11M, as amended by this Act, is amended
 12 13 by striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
 12 14 following:
 12 15    422.11M  Agricultural assets transfer tax credit.
 12 16    The taxes imposed under this division, less the credits
 12 17 allowed under section 422.12, shall be reduced by an
 12 18 agricultural assets transfer tax credit as allowed under

 12 20    Sec. 16.  Section 422.33, subsection 21, as amended by this
 12 21 Act, is amended by striking the subsection and inserting in

 12 31 is also repealed, unless that Act or another Act specifically
 12 32 provides otherwise.

 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the

 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 12  2 section is disallowed. The tax credit shall be recaptured
 12  3 and the amount of the tax credit shall be immediately due and

 12 32 provides otherwise.

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two

 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance

 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for

 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming

 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two

 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative

 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity

 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for

 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current

 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements

 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the

 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current

 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or

 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express

 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply

 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current

 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the

 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the

 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current

 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements

 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of

 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply

 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of

 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced

 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two

 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance

 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and

 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of

 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the

 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving

 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.

 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent

 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for

 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.

 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the

 15 23 tax credit.

 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements

 13  5                           EXPLANATION
 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the

 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein

 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two

 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance

 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.

 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18

 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of

 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply
 16  6 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
 16  7 or after that date.  The provisions of the bill that strike the
 16  8 new revised version and replace it with the restored current
 16  9 version take effect January 1, 2023, and apply to tax years
 16 10 beginning on or after that date.

 13  8    GENERAL ==== THREE VERSIONS.  This bill strikes the
 13  9 agricultural assets transfer tax credit (tax credit) as it
 13 10 has existed since January 1, 2018 (herein referred to as the
 13 11 current version), and replaces it with the tax credit as it
 13 12 had existed on December 31, 2017, with certain changes and
 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current

 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.

 13 13 designated as the "Agricultural Assets Transfer Tax Credit
 13 14 Program" (herein referred to as the new revised version).  The
 13 15 bill provides that the new revised version will be replaced
 13 16 again with the current version on January 1, 2023 (herein
 13 17 referred to as the restored current version).
 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.

 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer

 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity

 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18

 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.

 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 13 18    PROCEDURAL HISTORY.  The three versions are based on two
 13 19 forms of earlier legislation.  The current version and restored
 13 20 current versions are based on SF 2268 enacted in 2006 which was
 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.

 13 21 administered by the agricultural development board under Code
 13 22 chapter 175 (2006 Iowa Acts, chapter 1161).  The new revised
 13 23 version is based on HF 599 enacted in 2013 that included
 13 24 amendments to the original 2006 legislation (2013 Iowa Acts,
 13 25 chapter 125) and a new custom farming contract tax credit.
 13 26 Both tax credits were designated under the title "Beginning
 13 27 Farmer Tax Credit Program".  The program was administered
 13 28 by the agricultural development board.  In that same year,
 13 29 supervision of the board was transferred to the Iowa finance
 13 30 authority (authority) (2013 Iowa Acts, chapter 100)  and a year
 13 31 later the general assembly enacted SF 2328 transferring the
 13 32 program to Code chapter 16 as reorganized (2014 Iowa Acts,
 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.
 16  2 The 2013 amendments had also included a recapture provision.
 16  3    EFFECTIVE AND APPLICABILITY DATES.  The provisions of
 16  4 the bill that strike the current version and replace it with
 16  5 the new revised version take effect upon enactment and apply

 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18
 15 12 percent for veterans).  The 2013 amendments also limited the
 15 13 tax credit to not more than $50,000 in any tax year.
 15 14    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== AVAILABLE CEILING.  The current
 15 15 version and restored current version provide a $6 million
 15 16 ceiling on the aggregate amount of tax credit certificates
 15 17 that may be issued during any one year. The new revised
 15 18 version provides a $9 million ceiling.  The 2013 amendments
 15 19 had included a $12 million ceiling that supported both the
 15 20 agricultural assets transfer tax credit and the custom farming
 15 21 contract tax credit.  The new revised version, based on the
 15 22 2013 amendments, no longer includes a custom farming contract
 15 23 tax credit.
 15 24    DIFFERENCES IN PROVISIONS ==== MISCELLANEOUS.   The current
 15 25 version and restored current version provides that the tax
 15 26 credit is based on an agreement which includes arrangements
 15 27 for lease and rental payments based on either a cash or
 15 28 commodity share basis.  The new revised version provides that
 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
 15 31 also allowed for both arrangements but without an express
 15 32 limitation.   The current version and restored current version
 15 33 allow for capturing a prior allowed tax credit while the new
 15 34 revised version allows for any properly claimed tax credit but
 15 35 provides that the tax credit that had been allowed for the
 16  1 current tax year in which the termination occurs is disallowed.

 13 33 chapter 1080).
 13 34    PROVISIONS IN COMMON.  Under the three versions, a taxpayer
 13 35 who holds agricultural assets which must include agricultural
 14  1 land, and may include associated agricultural equipment, is
 14  2 entitled to claim a tax credit based on an agricultural assets
 14  3 transfer agreement (agreement) entered into by the taxpayer and
 14  4 a beginning farmer.  The agreement must provide for the lease
 14  5 of agricultural land and may provide for the associated rental
 14  6 of agricultural equipment.   The tax credit applies against
 14  7 individual or corporate tax liability equal to a percentage of
 14  8 the rent paid to the taxpayer by the beginning farmer on a cash
 14  9 or commodity share basis.   A beginning farmer's eligibility
 14 10 is based on the same requirements that apply to the beginning
 14 11 farmer loan program that is now also administered under the
 14 12 supervision of the authority.  An agreement cannot be for less
 14 13 than two and not more than five years, but renewal is allowed.
 14 14 A tax credit is not available under certain circumstances,
 14 15 including if the taxpayer is (1) at fault for terminating a
 14 16 prior agreement, (2) a party to a pending administrative or
 14 17 judicial action involving an environmental violation involving
 14 18 an animal feeding operation, or (3) classified as a habitual
 14 19 violator of such environmental regulations.  It also cannot
 14 20 be claimed if the agricultural assets are being leased or
 14 21 rented at a rate that is substantially higher or lower than
 14 22 the market rate.  Finally, the tax credit is not available if
 14 23 the agreement has been terminated.   A tax credit certificate
 14 24 is issued to the taxpayer on a first=come, first=served basis.
 14 25 The number of tax credit certificates is limited by a ceiling
 14 26 of moneys available to support the tax credit.  The legislative
 14 27 tax expenditure committee must review the tax credit according
 14 28 to its scheduled review of a number of other credits.
 14 29    DIFFERENCE IN PROVISIONS ==== TAX CREDIT CALCULATED.  The
 14 30 current and restored current versions provide that the tax
 14 31 credit equals 5 percent of the amount paid to the taxpayer
 14 32 under the agreement if made on a cash basis and 15 percent
 14 33 of the amount paid to the taxpayer if made on a commodity
 14 34 share basis.  Note, under these versions, there is no cap on
 14 35 the amount that may be claimed by the taxpayer in any tax
 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the
 15  4 percentage is increased by 1 percent for the first tax year.
 15  5 In addition, a taxpayer cannot claim more than $25,000 in any
 15  6 tax year.   Under the 2013 amendments, if the agreement was
 15  7 made on a cash basis, the tax credit equaled 7 percent and
 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a
 15 10 veterans preference equal to a one=year 1 percent increase for
 15 11 both types of payment arrangements (8 percent for cash and 18

 15  1 year.  The new revised version provides the taxpayer may claim
 15  2 the same percentages as provided in the current version but
 15  3 also includes a preference for veterans.  In that case, the

 15  8 if the agreement was made on a commodity share basis the tax
 15  9 credit equaled 17 percent.  The 2013 amendments also included a

 15 29 the tax credit may be based on either or both arrangements
 15 30 to the extent allowed by the authority.  The 2013 amendments
