  2 29 while under their control.
  2 30    c.  The material is not being accumulated speculatively
  2 31 pursuant to subsection 7.
  2 32    3.  If the department determines that a facility is not
  2 33 legitimately recycling material, the department may allow the
  2 34 facility owner or operator an opportunity to comply with the
  2 35 criteria in subsection 2, or may immediately deem the facility
  3  1 subject to the solid waste provisions of chapter 455B, division
  3  2 IV, part 1.
  3  3    4.  The criteria in subsection 2 are intended to mitigate
  3  4 the risk posed by facilities that accumulate materials
  3  5 speculatively prior to recycling by preventing materials that
  3  6 are not otherwise regulated under chapter 455B, division IV,
  3  7 part 1, from being stored indefinitely and potentially causing
  3  8 a public health nuisance or adverse environmental impact.
  3  9 In response to enforcement initiated by the department for
  3 10 alleged violations of this section, the burden of proof falls
  3 11 on the recycling facility owner or operator to establish that
  3 12 materials are being legitimately recycled.
  3 13    5.  To establish that a material is potentially recyclable
  3 14 and has a feasible means of being recycled into a valuable
  3 15 product, a recycling facility owner or operator shall maintain
  3 16 with an end user at least one purchase contract, a letter of
  3 17 understanding, or other formal agreement. Such documentation
  3 18 must be provided to the department upon request. In addition,
  3 19 if the material is going to be recycled in an unusual manner,
  3 20 the owner or operator may use technical specifications from the
  3 21 end user or other documentation to prove recycling the material
  3 22 in such manner will result in a valuable product.
  3 23    6.  To establish that a material is being managed as a
  3 24 valuable commodity while under their control, a recycling
  3 25 facility owner or operator shall ensure that stockpiled
  3 26 material is not speculatively accumulated by maintaining
  3 27 current inventory records and is managed in a manner consistent
  3 28 with comparable recyclable materials or products in an equally
  3 29 protective manner.
  3 30    7.  To establish that a material is not being accumulated
  3 31 speculatively, the recycling facility owner or operator must
  3 32 document that, during a given calendar year, the amount of
  3 33 material that is recycled, or transferred to a different
  3 34 site for recycling, equals at least seventy=five percent by
  3 35 weight or volume of the amount of material accumulated at
  4  1 the beginning of the period. Materials must be placed in a
  4  2 storage unit with a label indicating the first date that the
  4  3 material began to be accumulated. If placing a label on the
  4  4 storage unit is not practicable, the accumulation period must
  4  5 be documented through an inventory log or other appropriate
  4  6 method.
  4  7    8.  Failure to provide documentation upon request to the
  4  8 department relative to the requirements of this section is
  4  9 grounds for the department to immediately deem the facility not
  4 10 in compliance with this section.

  2 18 primary purpose of facilitating the recycling of materials that
  2 19 would otherwise be solid waste.
  2 20    2.  Recycling of materials for the purpose of being excluded
  2 21 from the solid waste provisions of chapter 455B, division
  2 22 IV, part 1, must be legitimate. A material that is not
  2 23 legitimately recycled is discarded material and is a solid

  3 14 and has a feasible means of being recycled into a valuable
  3 15 product, a recycling facility owner or operator shall maintain
  3 16 with an end user at least one purchase contract, a letter of
  3 17 understanding, or other formal agreement. Such documentation
  3 18 must be provided to the department upon request. In addition,
  3 19 if the material is going to be recycled in an unusual manner,
  3 20 the owner or operator may use technical specifications from the
  3 21 end user or other documentation to prove recycling the material
  3 22 in such manner will result in a valuable product.
  3 23    6.  To establish that a material is being managed as a
  3 24 valuable commodity while under their control, a recycling
  3 25 facility owner or operator shall ensure that stockpiled
  3 26 material is not speculatively accumulated by maintaining
  3 27 current inventory records and is managed in a manner consistent
  3 28 with comparable recyclable materials or products in an equally
  3 29 protective manner.
  3 30    7.  To establish that a material is not being accumulated
  3 31 speculatively, the recycling facility owner or operator must
  3 32 document that, during a given calendar year, the amount of
  3 33 material that is recycled, or transferred to a different
  3 34 site for recycling, equals at least seventy=five percent by
  3 35 weight or volume of the amount of material accumulated at
  4  1 the beginning of the period. Materials must be placed in a
  4  2 storage unit with a label indicating the first date that the
  4  3 material began to be accumulated. If placing a label on the
  4  4 storage unit is not practicable, the accumulation period must
  4  5 be documented through an inventory log or other appropriate
  4  6 method.
  4  7    8.  Failure to provide documentation upon request to the
  4  8 department relative to the requirements of this section is
  4  9 grounds for the department to immediately deem the facility not
  4 10 in compliance with this section.

  4 16    A person who violates section   2 23 legitimately recycled is discarded material and is a solid
  2 24 waste. In determining if recycling is legitimate, recycling
  2 25 facilities must establish all of the following:
  2 26    a.  The material is potentially recyclable and has a feasible
  2 27 means of being recycled into a valuable product.
  2 28    b.  The material is being managed as a valuable commodity
  2 29 while under their control.
  2 30    c.  The material is not being accumulated speculatively
  2 31 pursuant to subsection 7.
  2 32    3.  If the department determines that a facility is not
  2 33 legitimately recycling material, the department may allow the
  2 34 facility owner or operator an opportunity to comply with the
  2 35 criteria in subsection 2, or may immediately deem the facility
  3  1 subject to the solid waste provisions of chapter 455B, division
  3  2 IV, part 1.
  3  3    4.  The criteria in subsection 2 are intended to mitigate
  3  4 the risk posed by facilities that accumulate materials
  3  5 speculatively prior to recycling by preventing materials that
  3  6 are not otherwise regulated under chapter 455B, division IV,
  3  7 part 1, from being stored indefinitely and potentially causing
  3  8 a public health nuisance or adverse environmental impact.
  3  9 In response to enforcement initiated by the department for
  3 10 alleged violations of this section, the burden of proof falls
  3 11 on the recycling facility owner or operator to establish that

  3 13    5.  To establish that a material is potentially recyclable
  3 14 and has a feasible means of being recycled into a valuable
  3 15 product, a recycling facility owner or operator shall maintain
  3 16 with an end user at least one purchase contract, a letter of
  3 17 understanding, or other formal agreement. Such documentation
  3 18 must be provided to the department upon request. In addition,
  3 19 if the material is going to be recycled in an unusual manner,
  3 20 the owner or operator may use technical specifications from the
  3 21 end user or other documentation to prove recycling the material
  3 22 in such manner will result in a valuable product.
  3 23    6.  To establish that a material is being managed as a
  3 24 valuable commodity while under their control, a recycling
  3 25 facility owner or operator shall ensure that stockpiled
  3 26 material is not speculatively accumulated by maintaining
  3 27 current inventory records and is managed in a manner consistent
  3 28 with comparable recyclable materials or products in an equally
  3 29 protective manner.
  3 30    7.  To establish that a material is not being accumulated
  3 31 speculatively, the recycling facility owner or operator must
  3 32 document that, during a given calendar year, the amount of
  3 33 material that is recycled, or transferred to a different
  3 34 site for recycling, equals at least seventy=five percent by
  3 35 weight or volume of the amount of material accumulated at
  4  1 the beginning of the period. Materials must be placed in a
  4  2 storage unit with a label indicating the first date that the
  4  3 material began to be accumulated. If placing a label on the
  4  4 storage unit is not practicable, the accumulation period must
  4  5 be documented through an inventory log or other appropriate
  4  6 method.
  4  7    8.  Failure to provide documentation upon request to the
  4  8 department relative to the requirements of this section is
  4  9 grounds for the department to immediately deem the facility not

  4 16    A person who violates section   2 30    c.  The material is not being accumulated speculatively
  2 31 pursuant to subsection 7.
  2 32    3.  If the department determines that a facility is not
  2 33 legitimately recycling material, the department may allow the
  2 34 facility owner or operator an opportunity to comply with the
  2 35 criteria in subsection 2, or may immediately deem the facility
  3  1 subject to the solid waste provisions of chapter 455B, division
  3  2 IV, part 1.
  3  3    4.  The criteria in subsection 2 are intended to mitigate
  3  4 the risk posed by facilities that accumulate materials
  3  5 speculatively prior to recycling by preventing materials that
  3  6 are not otherwise regulated under chapter 455B, division IV,
  3  7 part 1, from being stored indefinitely and potentially causing
  3  8 a public health nuisance or adverse environmental impact.
  3  9 In response to enforcement initiated by the department for
  3 10 alleged violations of this section, the burden of proof falls
  3 11 on the recycling facility owner or operator to establish that

  4  1 the beginning of the period. Materials must be placed in a
  4  2 storage unit with a label indicating the first date that the
  4  3 material began to be accumulated. If placing a label on the
  4  4 storage unit is not practicable, the accumulation period must
  4  5 be documented through an inventory log or other appropriate
  4  6 method.
  4  7    8.  Failure to provide documentation upon request to the

  7  5 than annual.
  7  6    The director currently has the duty to conduct random
  7  7 inspections of work done by city and public works departments
  7  8 to ensure that such public works departments are complying with
  7  9 permit issuance and records reporting criteria regarding water
  7 10 and sewage projects. Rather than conduct random inspections
  7 11 of on=site files of city and county public works departments,
  7 12 the bill requires the director to periodically review permits
  7 13 and reports submitted by those agencies in accordance with Code
  7 14 section 455B.183(3).
  7 15    The current definition for "recycling" states that it is a
  7 16 process involving the collecting, separating, or processing
  7 17 of potential waste to revise or return the waste to use in
  7 18 the form of raw materials or products. The bill changes the
  7 19 definition of "recycling" by stating that recycling occurs
  7 20 pursuant to new Code section 455D.4A.  The bill also creates a
  7 21 definition for "recycling facility".
  7 22    Currently, the director may issue a compliance order
  7 23 to secure compliance or prevent a violation of any of the
  7 24 provisions relating to recycling and waste reduction. A person
  7 25 who violates a law that governs the disposal, storage, or
  7 26 handling of certain wastes, or a rule, permit, or order issued
  7 27 pursuant to one of those laws, is subject to a civil penalty
  7 28 of no more than $10,000. The department can request that the
  7 29 attorney general pursue litigation for that violation. A
  7 30 person found in violation after litigation shall be subject to
  7 31 a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day.
  7 32    The bill requires a recycling facility to prove that
  7 33 materials it stores are potentially recyclable. A person who
  7 34 fails to meet the criteria for legitimate recycling is subject
  7 35 to the provisions regarding compliance orders, litigation, and
  8  1 civil penalties.
  8  2    Since 2010, the department has had to submit a written
  8  3 report to the general assembly regarding issues related to the

  8  5 state. The bill deletes this duty.
  8  6    Currently, a geological survey exists within the department.
  8  7 The director of the department must provide supervision,
  8  8 direction, and coordination of functions of the state
  8  9 geologist. The director must appoint the state geologist, who
  8 10 must have a degree in geology from an accredited college or
  8 11 university and at least five years of geological experience.
  8 12 The director determines the state geologist's salary. The
  8 13 state geologist has the authority to lease or rent sufficient
  8 14 space for storage of well drilling samples, rock cores,
  8 15 fossils, and other materials as may be necessary to carry
  8 16 on investigations, with the approval of the director of the
  8 17 department of administrative services. The state geologist
  8 18 may assemble a complete cabinet collection to illustrate the
  8 19 natural products of the state.
  8 20    The state geologist must give to the governor an annual
  8 21 report that consists of the work from the preceding year. The
  8 22 state shall distribute all publications of the geological
  8 23 survey like any other publication of state officers when no
  8 24 special provision exists. The state geologist shall retain a
  8 25 sufficient number of copies to supply probable future demands
  8 26 and the state will sell any extra copies to persons making
  8 27 application therefor at the cost price of publication.
  8 28    The bill removes the geological survey from the department
  8 29 and places it in the state university of Iowa under the
  8 30 jurisdiction and authority of the state board of regents.
  8 31 The state board of regents will appoint the state geologist,
  8 32 who must have at least a master's degree in geology from an
  8 33 accredited college or university and five years of geological
  8 34 experience. The state board of regents will determine the
  8 35 salary for the state geologist. The state geologist will no
  9  1 longer have the authority to lease or rent sufficient space
  9  2 for storage of well drilling samples, rock cores, fossils, and
  9  3 other materials as may be necessary to carry on investigations.
  9  4 Additionally, the state geologist must assemble a complete
  9  5 cabinet collection to illustrate the natural products of the
  9  6 state.
  9  7    The bill requires the state geologist to annually report to
  9  8 the general assembly in addition to the governor. Geological
  9  9 survey publications will no longer be distributed or sold
  9 10 like other published reports of state officers, but rather be
  9 11 available electronically on an internet site maintained for the
  9 12 purpose of documenting these publications.
  9 13    There currently exists an independent redemption center
  9 14 grant program that awards grants for improvements to redemption
  9 15 centers that are not affiliated with or in any way a subsidiary
  9 16 of a dealer, distributor, or manufacturer and are either
  9 17 nonprofit or for=profit but have existed prior to July 1, 2008.
