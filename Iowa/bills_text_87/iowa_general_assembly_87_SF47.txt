 11 12                          APPLICABILITY
 11 13    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to elections held
 11 14 on or after January 1, 2019.
 11 15                           EXPLANATION
 11 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 18    This bill requires that a person provide proof of
 11 19 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 20 requirements relating to proof of identification and proof of
 11 21 residence for election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 17 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 20 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 21 for voting be labeled by the department of transportation as
 14 22 "For Voting Purposes Only".
 14 23    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 24 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 25 registration by mail.
 14 26    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to
 14 27 elections held on or after January 1, 2019.
       LSB 1274XS (4) 87
       aw/sc
 11  8 on or before (date of second general election following the

 11 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 18    This bill requires that a person provide proof of
 11 19 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 20 requirements relating to proof of identification and proof of
 11 21 residence for election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests

 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath

 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 17 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 20 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 21 for voting be labeled by the department of transportation as
 14 22 "For Voting Purposes Only".
 14 23    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 24 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 25 registration by mail.
 14 26    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to
 14 27 elections held on or after January 1, 2019.

 11 13    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to elections held

 11 15                           EXPLANATION
 11 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 18    This bill requires that a person provide proof of
 11 19 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 20 requirements relating to proof of identification and proof of
 11 21 residence for election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 17 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 20 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 21 for voting be labeled by the department of transportation as
 14 22 "For Voting Purposes Only".
 14 23    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 24 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 25 registration by mail.
 14 26    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to
 14 27 elections held on or after January 1, 2019.

 11 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 18    This bill requires that a person provide proof of
 11 19 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 20 requirements relating to proof of identification and proof of
 11 21 residence for election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 17 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 20 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 21 for voting be labeled by the department of transportation as
 14 22 "For Voting Purposes Only".
 14 23    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 24 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 25 registration by mail.

 11 15                           EXPLANATION
 11 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 18    This bill requires that a person provide proof of
 11 19 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 20 requirements relating to proof of identification and proof of
 11 21 residence for election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section

 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.

 11 14 on or after January 1, 2019.
 11 15                           EXPLANATION
 11 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 18    This bill requires that a person provide proof of
 11 19 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 20 requirements relating to proof of identification and proof of
 11 21 residence for election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 17 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 20 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 21 for voting be labeled by the department of transportation as
 14 22 "For Voting Purposes Only".
 14 23    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 24 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 25 registration by mail.
 14 26    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to

 11 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 18    This bill requires that a person provide proof of
 11 19 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 20 requirements relating to proof of identification and proof of
 11 21 residence for election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section

 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's

 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 17 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 20 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 21 for voting be labeled by the department of transportation as
 14 22 "For Voting Purposes Only".
 14 23    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 24 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 25 registration by mail.
 14 26    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to

 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification

 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person

 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to

 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests

 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath

 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by

 11 22    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 23 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 24 in=person absentee registration. The bill provides that
 11 25 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 26 identification the bill requires of a voter who is already
 11 27 registered to vote. The bill removes residential leases and
 11 28 property tax statements from the list of acceptable documents
 11 29 to provide proof of residence for election day and in=person
 11 30 absentee registration.
 11 31    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 32 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 33 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12 10 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 30 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 31 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 32 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 35 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 14  1 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  2 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  3 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 17 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 18 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 19 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 20 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 21 for voting be labeled by the department of transportation as
 14 22 "For Voting Purposes Only".

 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that

 11 34 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 35 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 12  1 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 12  2 the same piece of paper.
 12  3    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 12  4 identification to a precinct election official before being
 12  5 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  6 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  7 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  8 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  9 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the

 12 11 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12 12 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12 13 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 15 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by

 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by

 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be

 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit

 12 14    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification

 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such

 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a

 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter

 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption

 12 16 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 17 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 18 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 19 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 20 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 21 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 22 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 23 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 24 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 25 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 26 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 27 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 28 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 29 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 30 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 13  3 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 13  4 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 13  5 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  6 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  7 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  8 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  9 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit affirming that
 13 10 the voter is the person the voter claims to be and affirming
 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be

 13 33 ballot.
 13 34    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a

 14  4 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  5 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  6 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  7 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  8 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  9 to cast a provisional ballot. A person who willfully violates
 14 10 these provisions by falsely making or signing an affidavit in
 14 11 connection with an absentee ballot commits election misconduct
 14 12 in the first degree as vote fraud under current Code section
 14 13 39A.2, which constitutes a class "D" felony. A class "D"
 14 14 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than five years
 14 15 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
 14 16    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a

 12 31 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 32 oaths for the same election.
 12 33    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 34 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 35 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 13  1 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 13  2 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,

 13 11 that the voter is either indigent and unable to obtain proof of
 13 12 identification without the payment of a fee or that the voter
 13 13 has a religious objection to being photographed. The precinct
 13 14 election official shall indicate on the provisional ballot that
 13 15 the voter is casting a provisional ballot due to the voter's
 13 16 inability or refusal to present proof of identification.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 affirming indigency or religious objection. The bill also
 13 19 provides that any provisional ballot cast accompanied by
 13 20 an affidavit affirming indigency or religious objection
 13 21 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 22 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 23 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 24 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 25 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 26 of validity. A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
 13 27 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
 13 28 more than $7,500.
 13 29    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
