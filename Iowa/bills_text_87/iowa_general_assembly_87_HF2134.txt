  3 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 18    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 459, referred to as
  3 19 the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act", which is administered
  3 20 and enforced by the department of natural resources (DNR).
  3 21  The Code chapter in part regulates the housing of animals in
  3 22 a building and the storage and application of animal manure
  3 23 originating from a confinement feeding operation (operation),
  3 24 including a manure storage structure (structure).  The bill
  3 25 addresses two documents filed by the owner of an operation
  3 26 with DNR when it administers water quality regulations: (1)
  3 27 an application for a construction permit (permit) issued by
  3 28 DNR that authorizes the construction, including expansion, of
  3 29 a structure (Code section 459.303) and a manure management
  3 30 plan (MMP) governing the storage and application of manure
  3 31 originating from the operation (Code section 459.312).
  3 32    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that DNR cannot
  3 33 approve an MMP unless the owner furnishes a surety bond for
  3 34 $10 million for the purpose of paying costs resulting from the
  3 35 discharge of manure from the owner's operation.  Moneys payable
  4  1 under the bond must be used in cases in which the discharge
  4  2 has caused property damage.  The moneys must be used to: (1)
  4  3 reimburse the state or a political subdivision, or an agent
  4  4 of the state or political subdivision, for costs associated
  4  5 with containment or cleanup; (2) the restoration of wild animal
  4  6 populations or habitat; and (3) the payment of a judgment
  4  7 award recovered by a plaintiff in a civil action.  The bill
  4  8 provides for the expiration or cancellation of the bond.  DNR
  4  9 is authorized to suspend or revoke an MMP if a replacement bond
  4 10 is not filed.  The bill also provides that DNR is prohibited
  4 11 from issuing a permit to the owner authorizing the construction
  4 12 of any structure if a bond covering an operation has expired,
  4 13 been canceled, been suspended, or been revoked.
  4 14    BACKGROUND == OPERATIONS AND MMPS.  An operation is a
  4 15 location in which certain confined agricultural animals are
  4 16 housed in one or more buildings for at least 45 days during
  4 17 any 12=month period (Code section 459.102). Generally, an
  4 18 operation must retain manure that is produced at the location
  4 19 until the manure is transported and used according to water
  4 20 quality requirements (e.g., via application on farmland) (see
  4 21 Code section 459.311).  An MMP refers to both an original
  4 22 document and a document which updates the original plan.
  4 23 An updated plan must be filed with DNR on an annual basis
  4 24 (Code section 459.312).  A permit is required to construct a
  4 25 structure including a confinement building or associated manure
  4 26 storage structure (either formed or unformed) (Code section
  4 27 459.102).  As part of the application for a permit, the owner
  4 28 must have filed an MMP.

  3 31 originating from the operation (Code section 459.312).

  4  3 reimburse the state or a political subdivision, or an agent

  4  5 with containment or cleanup; (2) the restoration of wild animal

  4 14    BACKGROUND == OPERATIONS AND MMPS.  An operation is a
  4 15 location in which certain confined agricultural animals are
  4 16 housed in one or more buildings for at least 45 days during
  4 17 any 12=month period (Code section 459.102). Generally, an
  4 18 operation must retain manure that is produced at the location
  4 19 until the manure is transported and used according to water
  4 20 quality requirements (e.g., via application on farmland) (see
  4 21 Code section 459.311).  An MMP refers to both an original
  4 22 document and a document which updates the original plan.
  4 23 An updated plan must be filed with DNR on an annual basis
  4 24 (Code section 459.312).  A permit is required to construct a
