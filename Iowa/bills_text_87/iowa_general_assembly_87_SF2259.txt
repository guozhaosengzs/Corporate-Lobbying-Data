  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs

  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those

  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim

  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim

  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care

  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person

  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is

  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies

  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly

  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those

  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care

  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,

  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim

  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those

  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic

  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is

  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim

  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.

  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim

  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care

  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care

  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.

  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly

  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those

  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random

  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.

  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is

  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.

  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  2 18    c.  Retrospective utilization review of hospital
  2 19 readmissions that complies with any applicable federal law
  2 20 or regulatory requirements, prohibiting such reviews for a
  2 21 Medicaid member who is readmitted with a related medical

  2 35 organization's subcontractors.  Each managed care organization
  3  1 and each managed care organization's subcontractors shall
  3  2 pay any claim that the independent auditor determines to be
  3  3 incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any
  3  4 costs attributable to the annual audit.

  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and

  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative

  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care

  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark

  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,

  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's

  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable

  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data

  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and

  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark

  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative

  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any

  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data

  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and

  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly

  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a

  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 20                           EXPLANATION
  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,

  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies

  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly

  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs

  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 20                           EXPLANATION
  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 20                           EXPLANATION
  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's

  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those

  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any

  7 20                           EXPLANATION
  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 20                           EXPLANATION
  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 20                           EXPLANATION
  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies

  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any

  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly

  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random

  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's

  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care

  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 23    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care including process
  7 24 and contract requirements, and oversight.
  7 25    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  7 26 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  7 27 contracts to administer the provisions of the bill.
  7 28    The bill requires that, upon request by a Medicaid provider,
  7 29 DHS shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data
  7 30 to a Medicaid provider, under contract with a managed care
  7 31 organization (MCO), within 60 calendar days of the request.
  7 32 DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  7 33 providing the patient encounter data to a Medicaid provider.
  7 34    The bill requires an MCO to provide documentation to a
  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after
  8  2 receipt of the claim.  The bill specifies the information to be
  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly
  8  6 in=person training on claim adjustment reason codes and remark
  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement
  8 10 requirements, and program policies and procedures utilizing a
  8 11 format approved by DHS and incorporating information collected
  8 12 through surveys of Medicaid providers.
  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and
  8 14 require utilization of such uniform standards by all MCOs
  8 15 regarding a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  8 16 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers;
  8 17 procedures, requirements, and periodic reviews and reporting of
  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  7 35 Medicaid provider claimant when the MCO contests or denies
  8  1 a claim, in whole or in part, within 15 calendar days after

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly
  8  5 across all MCOs by DHS, and requires MCOs to offer quarterly

  8  7 codes.
  8  8    The bill requires MCOs to offer quarterly in=person
  8  9 education regarding billing guidelines, reimbursement

  8 13    The bill requires DHS to develop uniform standards and

  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim

  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
  9 10 subject to judicial review.

  8  3 included in the documentation, requires the MCO to utilize the
  8  4 standard coding and format of responses, established uniformly

  8 18 reductions in and limitations for prior authorization relative
  8 19 to services and prescriptions; retrospective utilization review
  8 20 of hospital readmissions; a grievance, appeal, external review,
  8 21 and state fair hearing process; and resolution of all appeals
  8 22 within a 60=day time frame.
  8 23    The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract with an
  8 24 independent auditor to, at least annually, review a random
  8 25 sample of all claims paid and denied by each MCO and each MCO's
  8 26 subcontractors, and provides for payment by an MCO of any claim
  8 27 that the independent auditor determines to be incorrectly
  8 28 denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and any costs
  8 29 attributable to the annual audit.
  8 30    The bill requires an MCO to pay 100 percent of the
  8 31 state=established per diem rate to nursing facilities for those
  8 32 nursing facility residents enrolled in Medicaid during any
  8 33 recredentialing process caused by a change in ownership of the
  8 34 nursing facility.
  8 35    The bill prohibits MCOs from discriminating against any
  9  1 licensed pharmacy or pharmacist located within the geographic
  9  2 coverage area of the MCO that is willing to meet the conditions
  9  3 for participating established by DHS and to accept reasonable
  9  4 contract terms offered by the MCO.
  9  5    The bill also establishes an external review process for the
  9  6 review of final adverse determinations of the MCOs' internal
  9  7 appeal processes. The bill provides that a final decision
  9  8 of an external reviewer may be reviewed in a contested case
  9  9 proceeding pursuant to Code chapter 17A, and ultimately is
