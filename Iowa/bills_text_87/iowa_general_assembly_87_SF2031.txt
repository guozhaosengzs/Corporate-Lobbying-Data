  6  2                           EXPLANATION
  6  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  5    This bill relates to voter registration by allowing
  6  6 registration of eligible electors to vote following review
  6  7 of electronic records received from driver's license and
  6  8 nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  6  9 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  6 10    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 11 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 12 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 13 the legal name, date of birth, residential address, mailing
  6 14 address, and social security number for each person submitting
  6 15 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 16 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 17 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 18 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 19 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 20 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 21 administrative rules of the department of transportation, an
  6 22 applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  6 23 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  6 24 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  6 25 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  6 26 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  6 27 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  6 28 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  6 29 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  6 30 state department of transportation.
  6 31    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to
  6 32 transmit the electronic records to the county commissioner of
  6 33 registration of the county where the person resides. The bill
  6 34 requires that the county commissioner review the electronic
  6 35 record and any other relevant information to determine if a
  7  1 person is an eligible elector. If the county commissioner
  7  2 determines a person to be an eligible elector and the person is
  7  3 not registered to vote in the county, the county commissioner
  7  4 is required to notify the person of the separate processes to
  7  5 decline to register to vote or to declare a political party
  7  6 affiliation. If a notified person fails to decline voter
  7  7 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  8 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  9 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7 10 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 11 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that
  7 12 county and send the person an acknowledgment as required by
  7 13 current law.
  7 14    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 15 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 16 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 17 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 18 acknowledgment of registration within seven working days of
  7 19 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 20 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify
  7 21 as an eligible elector does not constitute a completed voter
  7 22 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 23 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 24 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 25 for submitting such an application.
  7 26    The bill also grants the state voter registration
  7 27 commission, in consultation with the department of
  7 28 transportation, the authority to adopt rules to administer
  7 29 and interpret the provisions of the bill relating to voter
  7 30 registration at motor vehicle driver's license stations. If
  7 31 interpretive rulemaking authority is clearly vested in the
  7 32 discretion of an agency by statute, the applicable judicial
  7 33 standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  7 34 irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable interpretation
  7 35 of law by the agency (Code section 17A.19(10)(l)). If
  8  1 interpretive rulemaking authority is not clearly vested in
  8  2 the discretion of an agency, the applicable judicial standard
  8  3 of review is whether the rules constitute an erroneous
  8  4 interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8  5    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8  6 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter 9E by
  8  7 requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for administration
  8  8 of registration for those participants.
  8  9    The bill specifies that a requirement that separate
  8 10 registration forms be signed by each individual registrant only
  8 11 applies to paper registration forms.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.

  6  7 of electronic records received from driver's license and
  6  8 nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  6  9 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  6 10    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 11 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 12 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 13 the legal name, date of birth, residential address, mailing
  6 14 address, and social security number for each person submitting
  6 15 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 16 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 17 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 18 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 19 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 20 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 21 administrative rules of the department of transportation, an
  6 22 applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  6 23 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  6 24 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  6 25 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  6 26 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  6 27 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  6 28 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  6 29 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  6 30 state department of transportation.
  6 31    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to
  6 32 transmit the electronic records to the county commissioner of
  6 33 registration of the county where the person resides. The bill
  6 34 requires that the county commissioner review the electronic
  6 35 record and any other relevant information to determine if a
  7  1 person is an eligible elector. If the county commissioner
  7  2 determines a person to be an eligible elector and the person is
  7  3 not registered to vote in the county, the county commissioner
  7  4 is required to notify the person of the separate processes to
  7  5 decline to register to vote or to declare a political party
  7  6 affiliation. If a notified person fails to decline voter
  7  7 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  8 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  9 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7 10 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 11 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that
  7 12 county and send the person an acknowledgment as required by
  7 13 current law.
  7 14    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 15 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 16 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 17 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 18 acknowledgment of registration within seven working days of
  7 19 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 20 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify
  7 21 as an eligible elector does not constitute a completed voter
  7 22 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 23 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 24 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 25 for submitting such an application.
  7 26    The bill also grants the state voter registration
  7 27 commission, in consultation with the department of
  7 28 transportation, the authority to adopt rules to administer
  7 29 and interpret the provisions of the bill relating to voter
  7 30 registration at motor vehicle driver's license stations. If
  7 31 interpretive rulemaking authority is clearly vested in the
  7 32 discretion of an agency by statute, the applicable judicial
  7 33 standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  7 34 irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable interpretation
  7 35 of law by the agency (Code section 17A.19(10)(l)). If
  8  1 interpretive rulemaking authority is not clearly vested in
  8  2 the discretion of an agency, the applicable judicial standard
  8  3 of review is whether the rules constitute an erroneous
  8  4 interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8  5    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8  6 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter 9E by
  8  7 requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for administration
  8  8 of registration for those participants.
  8  9    The bill specifies that a requirement that separate
  8 10 registration forms be signed by each individual registrant only
  8 11 applies to paper registration forms.
  8 12    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 13 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 14 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 15 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 16 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
  8 17 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 18 mandate included in the bill.
  8 19    The bill takes effect January 1, 2019.

  7  8 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  9 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7 10 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 11 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that

  7 14    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 15 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 16 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 17 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an

  7 20 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify
  7 21 as an eligible elector does not constitute a completed voter
  7 22 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 23 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 24 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 25 for submitting such an application.

  8  2 the discretion of an agency, the applicable judicial standard
  8  3 of review is whether the rules constitute an erroneous

  6  7 of electronic records received from driver's license and

  6 10    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 11 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 12 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 13 the legal name, date of birth, residential address, mailing
  6 14 address, and social security number for each person submitting
  6 15 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 16 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 17 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 18 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 19 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 20 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 21 administrative rules of the department of transportation, an
  6 22 applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  6 23 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  6 24 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  6 25 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  6 26 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  6 27 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  6 28 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  6 29 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  6 30 state department of transportation.
  6 31    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to
  6 32 transmit the electronic records to the county commissioner of
  6 33 registration of the county where the person resides. The bill
  6 34 requires that the county commissioner review the electronic
  6 35 record and any other relevant information to determine if a
  7  1 person is an eligible elector. If the county commissioner
  7  2 determines a person to be an eligible elector and the person is
  7  3 not registered to vote in the county, the county commissioner
  7  4 is required to notify the person of the separate processes to
  7  5 decline to register to vote or to declare a political party
  7  6 affiliation. If a notified person fails to decline voter
  7  7 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  8 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  9 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7 10 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 11 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that
  7 12 county and send the person an acknowledgment as required by
  7 13 current law.
  7 14    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 15 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 16 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 17 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 18 acknowledgment of registration within seven working days of
  7 19 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 20 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify
  7 21 as an eligible elector does not constitute a completed voter
  7 22 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 23 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 24 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 25 for submitting such an application.
  7 26    The bill also grants the state voter registration
  7 27 commission, in consultation with the department of
  7 28 transportation, the authority to adopt rules to administer
  7 29 and interpret the provisions of the bill relating to voter
  7 30 registration at motor vehicle driver's license stations. If
  7 31 interpretive rulemaking authority is clearly vested in the
  7 32 discretion of an agency by statute, the applicable judicial
  7 33 standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  7 34 irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable interpretation
  7 35 of law by the agency (Code section 17A.19(10)(l)). If
  8  1 interpretive rulemaking authority is not clearly vested in
  8  2 the discretion of an agency, the applicable judicial standard
  8  3 of review is whether the rules constitute an erroneous
  8  4 interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

  7  7 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  8 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  9 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
