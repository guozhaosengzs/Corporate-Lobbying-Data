  2 27 necessary to process a claim have been received by a managed
  2 28 care organization, the managed care organization shall
  2 29 either provide payment to the claimant within the timelines
  2 30 specified in the managed care contract or, if the managed
  2 31 care organization is denying the claim in whole or in part,
  2 32 shall provide notice to the claimant including the reasons for
  2 33 such denial consistent with national industry best practice
  2 34 guidelines.
  2 35    b.  If a managed care organization discovers that a claims
  3  1 payment barrier is the result of a managed care organization's
  3  2 identified system configuration error, the managed care
  3  3 organization shall correct such error and shall fully and
  3  4 accurately reprocess the claims affected by the error within
  3  5 thirty days of such discovery or within a time frame approved
  3  6 by the department.  For the purposes of this paragraph,
  3  7 "configuration error" means an error in provider data, an
  3  8 incorrect fee schedule, or an incorrect claims edit.
  3  9    c.  The department of human services shall provide for
  3 10 the development and require the use of standardized Medicaid
  3 11 provider enrollment forms to be used by the department and
  3 12 uniform Medicaid provider credentialing standards to be used
  3 13 by managed care organizations.  The credentialing process is
  3 14 deemed to begin when the managed care organization has received
  3 15 all necessary credentialing materials from the provider and is
  3 16 deemed to have ended when written communication is mailed or
  3 17 faxed to the provider notifying the provider of the managed
  3 18 care organization's decision.
  3 19    d.  A managed care organization shall provide written notice
  3 20 to all affected individuals at least sixty days prior to a
  3 21 significant change in administrative procedures relating to
  3 22 the scope or coverage of benefits, billings and collections
  3 23 provisions, provider network provisions, member or provider
  3 24 services, prior authorization requirements, or any other terms
  3 25 of a managed care contract or agreement as determined by the
  3 26 department of human services.  A managed care organization may
  3 27 comply with the requirement of providing written notice under
  3 28 this paragraph by posting such written notice on the managed
  3 29 care organization's internet site.
  3 30    e.  The department of human services shall engage dedicated
  3 31 provider relations staff to assist Medicaid providers in
  3 32 resolving billing conflicts with managed care organizations
  3 33 including those involving denied claims, technical omissions,
  3 34 or incomplete information.  If the provider relations staff
  3 35 observe trends evidencing fraudulent claims or improper
  4  1 reimbursement, the staff shall forward such evidence to the
  4  2 department of human services for further review.
  4  3    f.  The department of human services shall adopt rules
  4  4 pursuant to chapter 17A to require the inclusion by a managed

  4  8    2.  MEMBER SERVICES AND PROCESSES.
  4  9    a.  If a Medicaid member prevails on appeal regarding the
  4 10 provision of services, the services subject to the appeal
  4 11 shall be extended for a period of time determined by the
  4 12 director of human services. However, services shall not be
  4 13 extended if there is a change in the member's condition that
  4 14 warrants a change in services as determined by the member's
  4 15 interdisciplinary team, there is a change in the member's
  4 16 eligibility status as determined by the department of human
  4 17 services, or the member voluntarily withdraws from services.
  4 18    b.  If a Medicaid member is receiving court=ordered services
  4 19 or treatment for a substance=related disorder pursuant to
  4 20 chapter 125 or for a mental illness pursuant to chapter 229,
  4 21 such services or treatment shall be provided and reimbursed
  4 22 for an initial period of three days before a managed care
  4 23 organization may apply medical necessity criteria to determine
  4 24 the most appropriate services, treatment, or placement for the
  4 25 Medicaid member.
  4 26    c.  The department of human services shall review and have
  4 27 approval authority for level of care reassessments for Medicaid
  4 28 long=term services and supports (LTSS) population members that
  4 29 indicate a decrease in the level of care. A managed care
  4 30 organization shall comply with the findings of the departmental
