  2 35                           EXPLANATION
  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  3  4 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  3  5 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  3  6 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  3  7 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  3  8 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  3  9 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  3 10 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  3 11 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  3 12 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  3 13 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  3 14 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  3 15 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  3 16 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  3 17 2020.
  3 18    The bill also establishes maximum total appropriation
  3 19 amounts for the fiscal years beginning July 1, 2018, and July
  3 20 1, 2019.  The appropriation for the fiscal year beginning July
  3 21 1, 2018, shall not exceed two=thirds of the total amount of
  3 22 moneys necessary to pay all commercial and industrial property
  3 23 tax replacement claims for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
  3 24 2016.  The appropriation for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
  3 25 2019, shall not exceed one=third of the total amount of moneys
  3 26 necessary to pay all commercial and industrial property tax
  3 27 replacement claims for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  3 28    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  3 29 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  3 30 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  3 31 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  3 32 review effective July 1, 2022.
  3 33    Except for the Code section of the bill amending Code section
  3 34 2.48, the bill takes effect upon enactment.
