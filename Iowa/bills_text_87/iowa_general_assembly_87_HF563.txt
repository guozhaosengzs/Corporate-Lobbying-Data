  1 19                           DIVISION II
  1 20              CONCUSSIONS OR BRAIN INJURY POLICIES
  1 21    Sec. 4.  Section 280.13C, Code 2017, is amended by striking
  1 22 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1 23    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1 24    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1 25 declares all of the following:
  1 26    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1 27 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1 28 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 29 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 30 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 31 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 32 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 33    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 34 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 35 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  2  1 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  2  2 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  2  3 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  2  4 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  2  5 without loss of consciousness.
  2  6    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  2  7 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  2  8 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  2  9 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  2 10 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  2 11 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  2 12 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  2 13 in this state.
  2 14    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  2 15 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  2 16 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  2 17 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the Iowa
  2 18 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2 19 athletic union are encouraged to establish and disseminate to
  2 20 all schools in this state a return=to=school protocol that is
  2 21 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with
  2 22 federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state are
  2 23 encouraged to adopt such protocols.
  2 24    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 25    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2 26    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 27 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 28    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 29 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 30 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 31    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 32 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 33 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 34 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 35    3.  Training.
  3  1    a.  The Iowa high school athletic association and the Iowa
  3  2 girls high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  3  3 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  3  4 injuries, including training regarding evaluation, prevention,
  3  5 symptoms, risks, and long=term effects of concussions and brain
  3  6 injuries.  Each coach or contest official shall complete such
  3  7 training at least every two years.
  3  8    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  3  9 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  3 10 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  3 11 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3 12 of such completion.
  3 13    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3 14    a.  The Iowa high school athletic association and the
  3 15 Iowa girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 16 distribute the centers for disease control and prevention
  3 17 guidelines and other pertinent information to inform and
  3 18 educate coaches, students, and the parents and guardians
  3 19 of students of the risks, signs, symptoms, and behaviors
  3 20 consistent with a concussion or brain injury, including
  3 21 the danger of continuing to participate in extracurricular
  3 22 interscholastic activities after suffering a concussion or
  3 23 brain injury and their responsibility to report such signs,
  3 24 symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 25    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3 26 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 27 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 28 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 29 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 30 or guardian shall sign and return the concussion and brain
  3 31 injury information sheet to the student's school prior to the
  3 32 student's participation in any extracurricular interscholastic
  3 33 activity for grades seven through twelve.
  3 34    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 35 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  4  1 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  4  2 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  4  3 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  4  4    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The Iowa high school athletic
  4  5 association and the Iowa girls high school athletic union
  4  6 shall work together to develop a return=to=play protocol,
  4  7 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  8 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  9 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4 10 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4 11 interscholastic activity after showing signs, symptoms, or
  4 12 behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury. The
  4 13 board of directors of each school district and the authorities
  4 14 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  4 15 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  4 16 activity which is a contest in grades seven through twelve
  4 17 shall adopt such protocols.
  4 18    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 19 or after July 1, 2017, the board of directors of each school
  4 20 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 21 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 22 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 23 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 24 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 25 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 26 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 27 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 28 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 29 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 30 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 31 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 32    Sec. 5.  APPLICABILITY PROVISIONS.  A person required to
  4 33 complete training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as
  4 34 enacted by this division of this Act, has until July 1, 2018,
  4 35 to initially complete such training.
  5  1    Sec. 6.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  2 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  3 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  4 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  5 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  6 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  7 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  8 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  9 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5 10 this division of this Act by and enforcement of this division
  5 11 of this Act against all affected school districts.

  1 20              CONCUSSIONS OR BRAIN INJURY POLICIES
  1 21    Sec. 4.  Section 280.13C, Code 2017, is amended by striking
  1 22 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1 23    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1 24    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1 25 declares all of the following:
  1 26    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1 27 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1 28 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 29 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 30 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 31 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 32 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 33    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 34 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 35 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  2  1 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  2  2 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  2  3 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  2  4 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  2  5 without loss of consciousness.
  2  6    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  2  7 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  2  8 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  2  9 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  2 10 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  2 11 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  2 12 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  2 13 in this state.
  2 14    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  2 15 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  2 16 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  2 17 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the Iowa
  2 18 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2 19 athletic union are encouraged to establish and disseminate to
  2 20 all schools in this state a return=to=school protocol that is
  2 21 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with
  2 22 federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state are
  2 23 encouraged to adopt such protocols.
  2 24    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:

  2 26    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 27 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 28    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 29 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 30 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 31    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 32 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 33 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 34 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 35    3.  Training.

  3  5 symptoms, risks, and long=term effects of concussions and brain
  3  6 injuries.  Each coach or contest official shall complete such
  3  7 training at least every two years.
  3  8    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  3  9 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  3 10 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  3 11 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3 12 of such completion.
  3 13    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3 14    a.  The Iowa high school athletic association and the
  3 15 Iowa girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 16 distribute the centers for disease control and prevention
  3 17 guidelines and other pertinent information to inform and
  3 18 educate coaches, students, and the parents and guardians
  3 19 of students of the risks, signs, symptoms, and behaviors
  3 20 consistent with a concussion or brain injury, including
  3 21 the danger of continuing to participate in extracurricular
  3 22 interscholastic activities after suffering a concussion or
  3 23 brain injury and their responsibility to report such signs,
  3 24 symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 25    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3 26 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 27 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 28 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 29 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 30 or guardian shall sign and return the concussion and brain
  3 31 injury information sheet to the student's school prior to the
  3 32 student's participation in any extracurricular interscholastic
  3 33 activity for grades seven through twelve.
  3 34    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 35 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  4  1 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  4  2 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  4  3 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  4  4    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The Iowa high school athletic
  4  5 association and the Iowa girls high school athletic union
  4  6 shall work together to develop a return=to=play protocol,
  4  7 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  8 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  9 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4 10 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4 11 interscholastic activity after showing signs, symptoms, or
  4 12 behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury. The
  4 13 board of directors of each school district and the authorities
  4 14 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  4 15 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  4 16 activity which is a contest in grades seven through twelve
  4 17 shall adopt such protocols.
  4 18    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 19 or after July 1, 2017, the board of directors of each school
  4 20 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 21 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 22 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 23 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 24 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 25 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 26 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 27 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 28 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 29 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 30 student needs but that is not required for participation in the

  1 20              CONCUSSIONS OR BRAIN INJURY POLICIES
  1 21    Sec. 4.  Section 280.13C, Code 2017, is amended by striking
  1 22 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1 23    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1 24    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1 25 declares all of the following:
  1 26    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1 27 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1 28 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 29 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 30 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 31 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 32 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 33    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 34 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 35 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  2  1 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  2  2 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  2  3 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  2  4 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  2  5 without loss of consciousness.
  2  6    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  2  7 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  2  8 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  2  9 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  2 10 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  2 11 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  2 12 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  2 13 in this state.
  2 14    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  2 15 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  2 16 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  2 17 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the Iowa

  2 19 athletic union are encouraged to establish and disseminate to
  2 20 all schools in this state a return=to=school protocol that is
  2 21 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with

  2 29 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 30 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 31    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 32 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 33 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 34 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.

  3  7 training at least every two years.
  3  8    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  3  9 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  3 10 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  3 11 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3 12 of such completion.
  3 13    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3 14    a.  The Iowa high school athletic association and the

  3 21 the danger of continuing to participate in extracurricular
  3 22 interscholastic activities after suffering a concussion or
  3 23 brain injury and their responsibility to report such signs,
  3 24 symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 25    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3 26 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 27 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 28 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 29 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 30 or guardian shall sign and return the concussion and brain
  3 31 injury information sheet to the student's school prior to the
  3 32 student's participation in any extracurricular interscholastic
  3 33 activity for grades seven through twelve.
  3 34    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 35 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  4  1 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  4  2 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  4  3 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  4  4    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The Iowa high school athletic
  4  5 association and the Iowa girls high school athletic union
  4  6 shall work together to develop a return=to=play protocol,
  4  7 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  8 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  9 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4 10 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4 11 interscholastic activity after showing signs, symptoms, or
  4 12 behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury. The
  4 13 board of directors of each school district and the authorities
  4 14 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  4 15 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  4 16 activity which is a contest in grades seven through twelve
  4 17 shall adopt such protocols.
  4 18    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 19 or after July 1, 2017, the board of directors of each school
  4 20 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 21 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 22 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a

  1 20              CONCUSSIONS OR BRAIN INJURY POLICIES
  1 21    Sec. 4.  Section 280.13C, Code 2017, is amended by striking
  1 22 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1 23    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1 24    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1 25 declares all of the following:
  1 26    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1 27 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1 28 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 29 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 30 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 31 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 32 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 33    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 34 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 35 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  2  1 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  2  2 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  2  3 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  2  4 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  2  5 without loss of consciousness.
  2  6    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  2  7 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  2  8 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  2  9 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  2 10 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  2 11 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  2 12 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  2 13 in this state.
  2 14    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  2 15 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  2 16 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  2 17 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the Iowa
  2 18 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2 19 athletic union are encouraged to establish and disseminate to
  2 20 all schools in this state a return=to=school protocol that is
  2 21 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with
  2 22 federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state are
  2 23 encouraged to adopt such protocols.
  2 24    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 25    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2 26    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 27 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 28    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 29 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 30 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 31    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 32 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 33 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 34 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 35    3.  Training.
  3  1    a.  The Iowa high school athletic association and the Iowa

  3  5 symptoms, risks, and long=term effects of concussions and brain
  3  6 injuries.  Each coach or contest official shall complete such
  3  7 training at least every two years.
  3  8    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  3  9 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  3 10 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  3 11 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3 12 of such completion.
  3 13    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3 14    a.  The Iowa high school athletic association and the
  3 15 Iowa girls high school athletic union shall work together to

  3 18 educate coaches, students, and the parents and guardians
  3 19 of students of the risks, signs, symptoms, and behaviors
  3 20 consistent with a concussion or brain injury, including
  3 21 the danger of continuing to participate in extracurricular
  3 22 interscholastic activities after suffering a concussion or
  3 23 brain injury and their responsibility to report such signs,
  3 24 symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 25    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3 26 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 27 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 28 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 29 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 30 or guardian shall sign and return the concussion and brain
  3 31 injury information sheet to the student's school prior to the
  3 32 student's participation in any extracurricular interscholastic
  3 33 activity for grades seven through twelve.
  3 34    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 35 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  4  1 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  4  2 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  4  3 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  4  4    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The Iowa high school athletic
  4  5 association and the Iowa girls high school athletic union
  4  6 shall work together to develop a return=to=play protocol,
  4  7 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  8 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  9 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4 10 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4 11 interscholastic activity after showing signs, symptoms, or
  4 12 behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury. The
  4 13 board of directors of each school district and the authorities
  4 14 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  4 15 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  4 16 activity which is a contest in grades seven through twelve
  4 17 shall adopt such protocols.
  4 18    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 19 or after July 1, 2017, the board of directors of each school
  4 20 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 21 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 22 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 23 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 24 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 25 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 26 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 27 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 28 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 29 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 30 student needs but that is not required for participation in the

  1 22 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  1 23    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1 24    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1 25 declares all of the following:
  1 26    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1 27 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1 28 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 29 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 30 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 31 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 32 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 33    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 34 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 35 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  2  1 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  2  2 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  2  3 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  2  4 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  2  5 without loss of consciousness.
  2  6    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  2  7 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  2  8 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  2  9 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  2 10 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  2 11 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  2 12 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  2 13 in this state.
  2 14    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  2 15 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  2 16 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  2 17 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the Iowa
  2 18 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2 19 athletic union are encouraged to establish and disseminate to
  2 20 all schools in this state a return=to=school protocol that is
  2 21 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with
  2 22 federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state are
  2 23 encouraged to adopt such protocols.
  2 24    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 25    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2 26    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 27 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 28    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 29 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 30 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 31    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 32 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 33 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 34 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.

  3  6 injuries.  Each coach or contest official shall complete such
  3  7 training at least every two years.
  3  8    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  3  9 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  3 10 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  3 11 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days

  3 29 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 30 or guardian shall sign and return the concussion and brain

  4 10 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4 11 interscholastic activity after showing signs, symptoms, or
  4 12 behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury. The
  4 13 board of directors of each school district and the authorities
  4 14 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  4 15 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  4 16 activity which is a contest in grades seven through twelve
  4 17 shall adopt such protocols.
  4 18    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on

  4 26 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 27 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 28 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 29 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 30 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 31 contest as provided in this subsection.

  1 25 declares all of the following:
  1 26    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1 27 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1 28 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 29 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 30 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 31 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 32 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 33    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 34 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 35 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  2  1 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  2  2 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  2  3 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  2  4 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  2  5 without loss of consciousness.
  2  6    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  2  7 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  2  8 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  2  9 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  2 10 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  2 11 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  2 12 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  2 13 in this state.
  2 14    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  2 15 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  2 16 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  2 17 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the Iowa
  2 18 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2 19 athletic union are encouraged to establish and disseminate to
  2 20 all schools in this state a return=to=school protocol that is
  2 21 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with
  2 22 federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state are
  2 23 encouraged to adopt such protocols.
  2 24    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:

  2 29 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 30 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 31    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,

  3  6 injuries.  Each coach or contest official shall complete such
  3  7 training at least every two years.
  3  8    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  3  9 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  3 10 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in

  4 10 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4 11 interscholastic activity after showing signs, symptoms, or
  4 12 behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain injury. The
  4 13 board of directors of each school district and the authorities

  1 28 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 29 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 30 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 31 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 32 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 33    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 34 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 35 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  2  1 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  2  2 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  2  3 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  2  4 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  2  5 without loss of consciousness.
  2  6    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  2  7 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  2  8 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  2  9 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  2 10 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  2 11 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  2 12 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  2 13 in this state.
  2 14    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  2 15 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  2 16 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  2 17 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the Iowa
  2 18 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2 19 athletic union are encouraged to establish and disseminate to
  2 20 all schools in this state a return=to=school protocol that is
  2 21 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with
  2 22 federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state are
  2 23 encouraged to adopt such protocols.
