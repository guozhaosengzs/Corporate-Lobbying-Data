  1 29                           EXPLANATION
  1 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 32    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  1 33 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in
  1 34 large part provides for the regulation of confinement feeding
  1 35 operations (operations) including associated confinement
  2  1 feeding operation structures (structures), such as buildings
  2  2 or manure storage structures, by the department of natural
  2  3 resources (DNR).
  2  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == REPORTING REQUIREMENT.  The bill
  2  5 provides that for purposes of administering and enforcing Code
  2  6 chapter 459, subchapter II relating to air quality and Code
  2  7 chapter 459, subchapter III relating to water quality, DNR
  2  8 may require that the owner or operator of an operation submit
  2  9 one or more animals confined reports that contain information
  2 10 regarding the number of animals maintained at the operation
  2 11 in a manner and during a time period that DNR determines is
  2 12 relevant. The report must present the information in a manner
  2 13 that calculates the number of animals maintained as animal
  2 14 units. The bill authorizes DNR to require a report as part of a
  2 15 construction permit to expand a structure.
  2 16    BACKGROUND == APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.  Under Code chapter
  2 17 459, subchapter II, applicable regulations based on an
  2 18 operation's size include separation distances required between
  2 19 a structure and a benefited object or location (e.g., a
  2 20 residence) (Code sections 459.202 and 459.203).  Special manure
  2 21 storage regulations apply to a qualified confinement feeding
  2 22 operation that exceeds a special threshold size (Code sections
  2 23 459.102 and 459.206). Under Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  2 24 the requirement to obtain a construction permit applies to an
  2 25 operation that exceeds a certain size (Code section 450.303).
  2 26 A number of exceptions also applies to a small animal feeding
  2 27 operation including requirements for the submission of a
  2 28 construction design statement (Code sections 459.306 and
  2 29 459.307), the submission of a manure management plan (Code
  2 30 sections 459.312 and 459.312A), the application of manure on
  2 31 snow covered or frozen ground (Code section 459.313A), and
  2 32 the certification of certain manure applicators (Code section
  2 33 459.315).
  2 34    BACKGROUND == ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.
  2 35  Compliance with a statutory regulation under the Code chapter
  3  1 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section
  3  2 459.103). Code section 459.602 provides for civil penalties
  3  3 that may be assessed for violations of Code chapter 459,
  3  4 subchapter II (air quality regulations). A violator is subject
  3  5 to Code section 455B.109, which provides for the administrative
  3  6 assessment of civil penalties of up to $10,000. Code section
  3  7 459.603 provides for civil penalties that may be assessed for
  3  8 violations of Code chapter 459, subchapter III (water quality
  3  9 regulations).  A violator is subject to either Code section
  3 10 455B.109 providing for the administrative assessment of civil
  3 11 penalties or Code section 455B.191, which provides for a
  3 12 general civil penalty assessed judicially of up to $5,000.
  3 13    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, takes effect upon
  3 14 enactment.
