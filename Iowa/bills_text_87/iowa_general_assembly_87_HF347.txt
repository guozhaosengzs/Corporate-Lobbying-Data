  2  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  6    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions which regulate
  2  7 the display of information specifying the classification of
  2  8 renewable fuel (ethanol blended gasoline, biobutanol blended
  2  9 gasoline, or biodiesel fuel), including the percentage of
  2 10 biofuels contained in the renewable fuel (e.g., designated as
  2 11 E=10, E=15, or E=85), being sold by retail dealers.
  2 12    ADVERTISING.  The bill removes a provision which requires
  2 13 that ethanol blended gasoline formulated with between 70 and 85
  2 14 percent ethanol by volume be advertised as E=85.  The bill also
  2 15 provides that a retail dealer selling ethanol blended gasoline,
  2 16 biobutanol blended gasoline, or biodiesel fuel may advertise
  2 17 the fuel in compliance with regulations promulgated by the
  2 18 United States environmental protection agency or the federal
  2 19 trade commission.
  2 20    LABELING.  The bill eliminates a provision which requires
  2 21 a motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline having
  2 22 an ethanol content of higher than 15 percent be affixed with a
  2 23 decal notifying consumers that the renewable fuel is for use in
  2 24 flexible fuel vehicles (Code section 214A.16). Instead, the
  2 25 decal must identify the ethanol blended gasoline as prescribed
  2 26 by rules adopted by the United States federal trade commission.
  2 27    FEDERAL LAW.  The United States environmental protection
  2 28 agency provides for the labeling of standard ethanol blended
  2 29 gasoline containing from 10 to 15 percent ethanol (40 C.F.R.
  2 30 pt. 80) for use in most motor vehicles and the federal trade
  2 31 commission provides for the labeling of higher than standard
  2 32 ethanol blended gasoline containing 16 or more percent ethanol
  2 33 (16 C.F.R. pt. 306) exclusively for use in flexible fuel
  2 34 vehicles.
  2 35    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  A person who violates a provision
  3  1 of the bill is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or subject
  3  2 to a civil penalty of between $100 and $1,000 (Code section
  3  3 214A.11).
