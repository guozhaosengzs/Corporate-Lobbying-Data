  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from

 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are

  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal

 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when

 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,

 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 28 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after

  8 30    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,

  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.

  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds

 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,

 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the

 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for

 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would

 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered

 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 30    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  8 31 subsection 41.
  8 32    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.9,

  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.

  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the

  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be

 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal

 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest

 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for

 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered

 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 28 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after
  8 29 January 1, 2018:
  8 30    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  8 31 subsection 41.
  8 32    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.9,
  8 33 subsection 2, paragraph "k".
  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 25 home purchase, and information regarding the amount of funds
  8 26 remaining, if any, in a first=time homebuyer savings account.
  8 27    Sec. 10.  APPLICABILITY.  The following provision or
  8 28 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after
  8 29 January 1, 2018:
  8 30    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  8 31 subsection 41.
  8 32    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.9,

  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 30    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,

  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the

  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state

  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of

  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal

 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax

  8 27    Sec. 10.  APPLICABILITY.  The following provision or
  8 28 provisions of this Act apply to tax years beginning on or after
  8 29 January 1, 2018:
  8 30    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.7,
  8 31 subsection 41.
  8 32    2.  The section of this Act enacting section 422.9,
  8 33 subsection 2, paragraph "k".
  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax

 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for

 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously

 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.

 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  2    This bill allows individuals, on or after January 1, 2018,
  9  3 to open an interest=bearing savings account with a state
  9  4 or federally chartered bank, savings and loan association,
  9  5 credit union, or trust company in this state and designate the
  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time
  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be

  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9  6 account as a first=time homebuyer savings account (account)
  9  7 for the purpose of financing the purchase of a single=family
  9  8 residence in this state by a first=time homebuyer.  "First=time

 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.

 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.

  9  9 homebuyer" is defined in the bill to include Iowa residents who
  9 10 have not owned a single=family residence for at least three
  9 11 years prior to the home purchase for which the account's funds
  9 12 are applied.  "Single=family residence" is also defined in the
  9 13 bill.  The account may be established individually, or jointly
  9 14 with a spouse if the married couple files a joint Iowa income
  9 15 tax return.
  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.

 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible

 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would

 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal

 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the

  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be
  9 29 a first=time homebuyer.
  9 30    Contributions to an account may be made in the form of cash
  9 31 by any person and in any amount.  There is no limitation on the
  9 32 amount that may be retained in an account.  In addition, the
  9 33 account holder may withdraw funds from an account at any time.
  9 34 Account funds shall not be used to pay expenses, if any, of
  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement
 10  7 issued for the account.
 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.
 11 29    The tax provisions of the bill apply to tax years beginning
 11 30 on or after January 1, 2018.

  9 16    In order to properly establish the account, the bill
  9 17 requires the account holder to submit certain forms to the
  9 18 department of revenue (department) designating the account as
  9 19 a first=time homebuyer savings account, and designating one
  9 20 beneficiary of the account (designated beneficiary).  These
  9 21 designation forms must be submitted no later than April 30 of
  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.

 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,

 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the

 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.

 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the

  9 22 the year following the tax year during which the account is
  9 23 opened.  An individual may establish more than one account,
  9 24 provided each account has a different designated beneficiary.
  9 25 The account holder may change the designated beneficiary at any
  9 26 time, and may designate himself or herself as the beneficiary.
  9 27 In addition, an individual may be the designated beneficiary
  9 28 of more than one account.  The designated beneficiary must be

 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement

 10  8    The bill provides protection to financial institutions from
 10  9 being required to perform, and from being responsible or liable
 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed

 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the

 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible

 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified

 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.

 10 10 for, certain activities as described in the bill with respect
 10 11 to accounts.  The bill requires the department to create the
 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
 11 28 purposes.

  9 35 administering the account, except that fees and charges may be
 10  1 deducted from the account by the financial institution where
 10  2 the account is held.  The bill requires an account holder to
 10  3 submit certain reports to the department, including an annual
 10  4 report for the account, a transaction report upon a withdrawal
 10  5 of funds from the account, and a copy of any federal Internal
 10  6 Revenue Service form 1099 or other similar income statement

 10 12 forms required to be filed by account holders, and to adopt
 10 13 rules to implement and administer the bill.
 10 14    The bill provides two individual income tax incentives
 10 15 relating to the accounts.  First, an account holder is
 10 16 allowed to deduct from the individual income tax the amount of
 10 17 contributions made during the year by the account holder to
 10 18 the account holder's accounts, not to exceed $2,000 per year,
 10 19 or $4,000 for married taxpayers with a joint account.  These
 10 20 amounts are adjusted for inflation each calendar year.  Second,
 10 21 the bill exempts from the individual income tax any interest
 10 22 or earnings received from the account holder's accounts.
 10 23 The total amount that may be deducted or excluded from the
 10 24 individual income tax for these two tax incentives cannot
 10 25 exceed an aggregate lifetime limit of 10 times the maximum
 10 26 deduction determined above for the applicable year ($20,000 for
 10 27 2016), or double that amount for married taxpayers with a joint
 10 28 account ($40,000 for 2016).  The account holder's ability to
 10 29 claim the tax incentives ends 10 tax years after the tax year
 10 30 the account holder first opened an account, or on the date when
 10 31 account funds are withdrawn for purposes other than the payment
 10 32 or reimbursement of the designated beneficiary's eligible
 10 33 home costs in connection with a qualified home purchase
 10 34 (nonqualified withdrawal), whichever occurs first.  "Eligible
 10 35 home costs" and "qualified home purchase" are both defined in
 11  1 the bill.  Amounts transferred between different accounts of
 11  2 the same account holder by a person other than the account
 11  3 holder are not considered a nonqualified withdrawal that would
 11  4 cause loss of the ability to claim the tax incentives.
 11  5    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income for
 11  6 purposes of calculating the individual income tax any amount of
 11  7 a nonqualified withdrawal from an account to the extent it was
 11  8 previously deducted as a contribution, but amounts transferred
 11  9 between different accounts of the same account holder by
 11 10 a person other than the account holder are not considered
 11 11 nonqualified withdrawals.  In addition, any amount remaining in
 11 12 an account holder's account on January 1 of the 10th calendar
 11 13 year after the calendar year during which the account holder
 11 14 first opened an account is considered to be a nonqualified
 11 15 withdrawal that must be added to net income for the tax year
 11 16 beginning in that 10th year, to the extent it was previously
 11 17 deducted as a contribution.  Nonqualified withdrawals required
 11 18 to be added to net income are also subject to a penalty equal
 11 19 to 10 percent of the nonqualified withdrawal, unless the
 11 20 withdrawal was made by reason of the death or disability of the
 11 21 account holder, or was made pursuant to a garnishment, levy,
 11 22 or other order, including an order in bankruptcy following a
 11 23 filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy code.
 11 24    Finally, the bill prohibits the amount of eligible home
 11 25 costs in connection with a qualified home purchase that are
 11 26 paid or reimbursed from funds in an account from being allowed
 11 27 as an itemized deduction for Iowa individual income tax
