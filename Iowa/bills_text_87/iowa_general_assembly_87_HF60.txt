  1  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  6    This bill eliminates the provision that prohibits a peace
  1  7 officer from stopping or detaining a person solely for a
  1  8 violation of Code section 321.276, which relates to texting
  1  9 while driving.
  1 10    The scheduled fine for a violation of Code section 321.276
  1 11 remains $30. Under current law, the offense is not a moving
  1 12 violation, and therefore cannot be considered for purposes
  1 13 of administrative suspension of a driver's license or for
  1 14 establishing habitual offender status. However, if the
  1 15 violation causes a serious injury, a court could impose an
  1 16 additional fine of $500 or suspend the person's driver's
  1 17 license for not more than 90 days, or both. If the violation
  1 18 causes a death, a court could impose an additional fine of
  1 19 $1,000 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more
  1 20 than 180 days, or both.
