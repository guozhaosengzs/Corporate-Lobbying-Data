  3 21 comply with any duty imposed by this subsection constitutes a
  3 22 violation of section 714.16, subsection 2, paragraph "a".

  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill allows a licensed motor vehicle dealer to sell
  3 30 a used motor home on a consignment basis if the dealer is
  3 31 licensed to sell used motor vehicles, the dealer prominently
  3 32 displays the words "consignment vehicle" on the motor home
  3 33 and indicates clearly in the sales documentation that the
  3 34 motor home is a consignment vehicle, the dealer puts customers
  3 35 on notice that the dealer does not have title to the motor
  4  1 home and does not warranty the title, the dealer assumes
  4  2 no liability for damages resulting from a customer's test
  4  3 drive of the motor home, the consignor maintains financial
  4  4 liability coverage for the motor home throughout the term of
  4  5 the consignment, and the consignor provides the dealer with a
  4  6 damage disclosure statement and an odometer statement for the
  4  7 motor home, which the dealer must make available upon request
  4  8 to a customer. The bill provides that for purposes of Code
  4  9 section 321.69 (damage disclosure statement) and Code section
  4 10 321.71 (odometer requirements), the consignor, not the dealer,
  4 11 shall be deemed the transferor or seller of the motor home.
  4 12    The bill allows a licensed travel trailer dealer to sell a
  4 13 used travel trailer on a consignment basis if the dealer is
  4 14 licensed to sell used travel trailers, the dealer prominently
  4 15 displays the words "consignment vehicle" on the travel trailer
  4 16 and indicates clearly in the sales documentation that the
  4 17 travel trailer is a consignment vehicle, the dealer puts
  4 18 customers on notice that the dealer does not have title to the
  4 19 travel trailer and does not warranty the title, the dealer
  4 20 assumes no liability for damages resulting from a customer's
  4 21 test drive of a motor vehicle towing the travel trailer, and
  4 22 the consignor provides the dealer with a damage disclosure
  4 23 statement for the travel trailer, which the dealer shall make
  4 24 available upon request to a customer.
  4 25    The bill requires travel trailer damage disclosure
  4 26 statements to, at a minimum, state whether the consignor
  4 27 knows if the travel trailer was titled as a salvage, rebuilt,
  4 28 or flood vehicle in this or any other state, as applicable,
  4 29 prior to the consignor's ownership of the vehicle and, if
  4 30 not, whether the consignor knows if the travel trailer was
  4 31 damaged to the extent that, were the travel trailer a motor
  4 32 vehicle, it would be a wrecked or salvage vehicle as defined
  4 33 in Code section 321.52 during or prior to the consignor's
  4 34 ownership of the travel trailer. The bill provides that damage
  4 35 disclosure statement forms shall be approved by the department
  5  1 of transportation (DOT).  The bill requires the consignor to
  5  2 maintain a copy of the damage disclosure statement for five
  5  3 years following the date of the statement, which copy must be
  5  4 made available to the DOT or the attorney general upon request.
  5  5    Under current law, Code section 321.69 provides that
  5  6 a person who knowingly makes a false motor vehicle damage
  5  7 disclosure statement or fails to make a required motor
  5  8 vehicle damage disclosure statement commits a fraudulent
  5  9 practice punishable by certain criminal penalties under
  5 10 Code sections 714.9 through 714.13. Failure of a person,
  5 11 vehicle recycler, or vehicle dealer to comply with any duty
  5 12 imposed by Code section 321.69 constitutes a violation of
  5 13 Code section 714.16(2)(a) (consumer frauds), which is subject
  5 14 to civil remedies and penalties. The bill provides that a
  5 15 consignor who knowingly makes a false travel trailer damage
  5 16 disclosure statement or fails to make a travel trailer damage
  5 17 disclosure statement required by the bill commits a fraudulent
  5 18 practice punishable by criminal penalties under Code sections
  5 19 714.9 through 714.13. The bill also provides that failure
  5 20 of a consignor to comply with any duty imposed by new Code
  5 21 section 322C.13(4) constitutes a violation of Code section
  5 22 714.16(2)(a), which is subject to civil remedies and penalties.
  5 23 In addition, the bill provides that a person who commits the
  5 24 violation may be subject to a private cause of action under
  5 25 Code chapter 714H (consumer fraud == private actions).
  5 26    The bill excludes dealers selling motor homes or travel
  5 27 trailers on a consignment basis from various requirements
  5 28 for obtaining a title or a manufacturer's or importer's
  5 29 certificate, or acknowledging assignment and warranty of title.
