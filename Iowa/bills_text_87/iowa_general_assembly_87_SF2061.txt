  5 20 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides

  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the

  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 31 incentive program for employees of the legislative branch
  4 32 consistent with the program provided in this section for

  5  1 establish the program as required under this section as nearly
  5  2 as identical as possible to the program provided executive
  5  3 branch employees under this section.  The program provided

  5 19    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  5 20 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive

  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium

  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to

  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the

  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,

  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from

  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment

  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of

  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement

  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of

  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive

  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the

  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides

  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement

  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but

  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be

  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not

  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement

  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November

  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,

  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the

  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of

  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive

  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the

  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from

  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.

  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program

  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November

  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not

  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides

  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
  7  5    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.

  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,

  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive

  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not

  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,

  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill establishes a state employee retirement incentive
  5 25 program for eligible employees of the executive branch of the
  5 26 state, including employees in the offices of statewide elective
  5 27 officials, employees of a judicial district department of
  5 28 correctional services, and if the board of regents approves,
  5 29 employees of the state board of regents and its institutions.
  5 30 The bill permits, but does not require, either the legislative
  5 31 branch or the judicial branch to establish an early retirement
  5 32 program consistent with the program provided to executive
  5 33 branch employees in the bill.  An elected official, or an
  5 34 employee eligible for an enhanced sick leave conversion program
  5 35 under Code section 70A.23(4) are excluded from participating
  6  1 in the program.  The program shall be administered by the
  6  2 department of administrative services (DAS).  The bill permits
  6  3 eligible executive branch employees who have completed an
  6  4 application for benefits under the Iowa public employees'
  6  5 retirement system (IPERS) with an intended first month
  6  6 of entitlement of no later than the month following the
  6  7 date eligible employees shall be required to separate from
  6  8 employment, to separate from service with the state and receive
  6  9 a benefit under the program.   To receive the incentive benefit,
  6 10 an eligible employee must submit an application to participate
  6 11 in the program by the eligible enrollment date, be accepted to
  6 12 participate in the program by the departments of administrative
  6 13 services and management, separate from state employment within
  6 14 30 days of the eligible enrollment date, and acknowledge the
  6 15 employee's ineligibility to return to employment with the
  6 16 state. The bill defines eligible enrollment date as the date
  6 17 established by DAS, no earlier than 45 days but no later than
  6 18 60 days after the effective date of the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that the benefit provided to an eligible
  6 20 employee who participates in the program is an amount equal to
  6 21 the entire value of the eligible employee's accumulated but
  6 22 unused vacation plus, if the employee has at least 10 years
  6 23 of state employment, $1,000 for each year of state employment
  6 24 up to 25 years.  The bill provides that this amount shall be
  6 25 payable in five equal installments each year during November
  6 26 beginning in November 2018.  In addition, the bill provides
  6 27 that a participant in the program, or the participant's
  6 28 surviving spouse, shall receive a health insurance premium
  6 29 benefit to pay the premium cost for eligible state group
  6 30 health insurance for five years following the participant's
  6 31 termination from state employment.  However, the bill provides
  6 32 that a participant shall receive the health insurance premium
  6 33 benefit only when the participant is no longer eligible for,
  6 34 or exhausts, the participant's available remaining value of
  6 35 sick leave used to pay the state share for the participant's
  7  1 continuation of state group health insurance coverage as
  7  2 provided in Code section 70A.23, subsection 3.
  7  3    The bill further provides that a state employer shall not
  7  4 hire a participant in the program for any employment.
