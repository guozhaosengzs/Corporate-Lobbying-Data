 11 27                           EXPLANATION
 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly

 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the

 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license

 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit

 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a

 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the

 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The

 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,

 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending

 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms

 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who

 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate

 11 17 credit loan is referred for collection to an attorney other
 11 18 than an employee of the licensee.

 11 27                           EXPLANATION
 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

       gh/sc
 11 13    a.  A delinquency charge if an installment is not paid in
 11 14 full within seven days, equal to five percent of the amount of

 11 16    b.  Court costs and reasonable attorney fees if the flexible
 11 17 credit loan is referred for collection to an attorney other
 11 18 than an employee of the licensee.
 11 19    c.  A dishonored check service fee if a licensee receives
 11 20 a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar
 11 21 instrument that is not paid or is not honored by a depository
 11 22 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 11 23 depository institution.
 11 24    2.  A licensee shall not directly or indirectly charge,
 11 25 contract for, or receive any other amount in connection with a
 11 26 flexible credit loan except as provided in this chapter.
 11 27                           EXPLANATION
 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,

 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who

 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit

 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.

 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 11 22 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 11 23 depository institution.

 11 26 flexible credit loan except as provided in this chapter.
 11 27                           EXPLANATION
 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 11 20 a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar
 11 21 instrument that is not paid or is not honored by a depository
 11 22 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 11 23 depository institution.
 11 24    2.  A licensee shall not directly or indirectly charge,
 11 25 contract for, or receive any other amount in connection with a
 11 26 flexible credit loan except as provided in this chapter.

 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,

 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.

 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the

 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make

 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending

 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible

 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms

 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch

 11 27                           EXPLANATION
 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 11 22 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 11 23 depository institution.

 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly

 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.

 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license

 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 11 27                           EXPLANATION
 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is

 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than

 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,

 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the

 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent

 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending

 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible

 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms

 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of

 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An

 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300

 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch

 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300

 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with

 11 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 30    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 11 31 of persons who wish to provide flexible credit loans to
 11 32 residents of the state.
 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.

 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with

 11 33    The bill defines "flexible credit loan" to mean a loan that
 11 34 is incurred for a personal, family, or household purpose, is
 11 35 not less than $500 and not more than $2,500, is unsecured,
 12  1 is payable in substantially equal installment payments of
 12  2 principal and interest for the term of the loan, is subject to
 12  3 prepayment in whole or in part at any time without penalty, and
 12  4 is for a term length of a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of
 12  5 24 months.
 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),

 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with

 12  6    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 12  7 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 12  8 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 12  9 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 12 10 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 12 11 engaged in the business of making flexible credit loans, as
 12 12 defined in the bill, a person who is licensed pursuant to
 12 13 another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that the person's
 12 14 activities are governed by that Code chapter, or a consumer
 12 15 loan provided under Code chapters 533D, 535C, 536, 536A, 536C,
 12 16 or 537.
 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage

 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited

 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the

 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than

 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late

 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,

 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the

 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction

 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.

 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate

 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the

 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of

 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided

 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee

 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.

 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction

 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make

 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of

 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending

 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms

 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure

 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 12 17    The bill prohibits a person from engaging in the business
 12 18 of making flexible credit loans to a resident in this state
 12 19 without first obtaining a license from the superintendent
 12 20 of the banking division in the department of commerce. An
 12 21 applicant for a license must submit an application in the form
 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan

 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.

 12 22 prescribed by the superintendent and pay a fee of $100.
 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the

 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least
 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for

 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee

 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction

 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.

 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the

 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make

 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a

 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 12 23    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a license if the
 12 24 applicant is insolvent, has failed to demonstrate the financial
 12 25 responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness
 12 26 required, as determined by rule, has failed to pay the $100
 12 27 fee, or has failed to demonstrate the availability of at least

 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late

 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,

 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the

 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The

 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has

 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate
 15 31 not to exceed 17 percent per month. However, a licensee is
 15 32 not permitted to compound a finance charge. In addition to
 15 33 this, a licensee may collect a delinquency charge, court costs
 15 34 and reasonable attorney fees, and a dishonored check service
 15 35 fee, as described in the bill. A licensee is prohibited
 16  1 from collecting any other charges or fees in connection with
 16  2 conducting flexible credit loan transactions.

 12 28 $25,000 in assets for use in the conduct of the business for
 12 29 the licensed office and each licensed branch office.
 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than
 13 11 what is indicated on the license, provided, however, that
 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who

 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,

 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the

 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a

 12 30    The bill requires the superintendent to issue a license
 12 31 within 30 days of receiving an application unless grounds exist
 12 32 for denying it. A license is valid for one year, from January
 12 33 1 to December 31, remains in full force until surrendered,
 12 34 revoked, or suspended, and is not transferable. A license
 12 35 remains the property of the state and must be immediately
 13  1 returned to the superintendent if a licensee voluntarily
 13  2 surrenders it. A license must be posted conspicuously in the
 13  3 office of the licensee and any licensed branch offices.
 13  4    The bill requires a licensee to designate the principal
 13  5 place of business to be indicated on the license. A licensee
 13  6 wishing to maintain more than one place of business may
 13  7 obtain a branch office license by submitting an application
 13  8 as prescribed by the superintendent and paying a $250 fee.
 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than

 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if
 13 16 the superintendent is notified. A licensee can change the
 13 17 license location by giving the superintendent written notice to
 13 18 amend the license.
 13 19    The bill authorizes a licensee to conduct flexible credit
 13 20 loan transactions from any licensed office location where other
 13 21 business activities unrelated to flexible credit lending occur.
 13 22 However, the superintendent may prohibit a licensee from
 13 23 conducting business as a flexible credit lender in conjunction
 13 24 with, or at the location of, such other business if the other
 13 25 business is being conducted in an unlawful manner.
 13 26    The bill allows a licensee to obtain a renewal license by
 13 27 submitting an application as prescribed by the superintendent
 13 28 no later than December 1 and paying a $250 fee. A renewal
 13 29 application submitted after December 1 is subject to a $10 late
 13 30 fee for each day it is late. A license of a licensee who has
 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,
 13 34 is not a person of honesty, truthfulness, and good character,
 13 35 as determined by rule, has failed to pay the renewal fee, has
 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the
 14  3 conduct of the business for each office. The superintendent
 14  4 may deny a renewal license or suspend or revoke a license if a
 14  5 fact or condition exists to have warranted the superintendent
 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make
 14 10 all records kept outside of the state available to the
 14 11 superintendent within three business days upon request. A
 14 12 licensee must provide the superintendent with access to
 14 13 the licensee's records during normal business hours. A
 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
 14 17 days must pay a late fee of up to 5 percent of the amount of the
 14 18 fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 14 19    The bill requires a licensee to provide the superintendent
 14 20 with an annual report on or before April 1, which may be
 14 21 extended for no more than 60 days upon showing good cause. The
 14 22 report must include the licensee's average annual percentage
 14 23 rate, as defined in the bill, and average loan amount during
 14 24 the 12=month period ending the preceding December 31. The
 14 25 superintendent may examine the records of a licensee who has
 14 26 failed to file an annual report, prepare the annual report, and
 14 27 charge a fee based on the cost of the examination. A licensee
 14 28 who has failed to file an annual report without an extension is
 14 29 also subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $5 for each day
 14 30 until the report is filed, which must be paid within 30 days of
 14 31 being charged.
 14 32    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 14 33 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 14 34 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting flexible credit
 14 35 loan or the ability of a lender to service a preexisting loan
 15  1 outside of this state.
 15  2    The bill restricts a licensee from advertising in any false
 15  3 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of a
 15  4 flexible credit loan and requires a licensee to comply with
 15  5 the advertising requirements in the federal Truth in Lending
 15  6 Act. A licensee cannot provide a flexible credit loan to a
 15  7 military member or dependent, as defined in 10 U.S.C. {987(i),
 15  8 with an annual percentage rate greater than that provided in
 15  9 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee may provide a flexible
 15 10 credit loan, the consumer must sign a statement attesting to
 15 11 whether or not the consumer is a military member or dependent.
 15 12 A loan made in violation of 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms
 15 13 and conditions unenforceable.
 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code
 15 16 chapter 536B but who is not licensed is void and its terms and
 15 17 conditions unenforceable. However, any other noncompliance
 15 18 with new Code chapter 536B, except pertaining to military
 15 19 members and their dependents, will not affect the validity of
 15 20 a flexible credit loan.
 15 21    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 15 22 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 15 23 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 15 24 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 15 25 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 15 26 provides electronic flexible credit loans. A licensee who
 15 27 fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $300
 15 28 for each violation.
 15 29    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge,
 15 30 as defined in the bill, on a flexible credit loan at a rate

 15 14    The bill provides that a flexible credit loan provided
 15 15 by a person who is required to be licensed under new Code

 13  9 A licensee is prohibited from conducting flexible credit
 13 10 loan transactions under any name or location different than

 13 12 a licensee may provide loans by mail or electronic means,
 13 13 make an accommodation to a consumer at any location upon
 13 14 the consumer's request, or conduct an administrative, loan
 13 15 servicing, or recordkeeping activity at any other location if

 13 31 not filed a renewal or paid the fee by December 31 expires.
 13 32    The bill allows the superintendent to deny a renewal license
 13 33 or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee is insolvent,

 14  1 failed to file an annual report, or has failed to demonstrate
 14  2 the availability of at least $25,000 in assets for use in the

 14  6 to refuse to originally issue the license.
 14  7    The bill requires a licensee to keep records for the
 14  8 superintendent to determine whether the licensee is complying
 14  9 with the bill for at least two years. A licensee must make

 14 14 licensee subjected to an examination of its records by the
 14 15 superintendent must pay a fee determined by the actual cost of
 14 16 the examination. A licensee who fails to pay the fee within 30
