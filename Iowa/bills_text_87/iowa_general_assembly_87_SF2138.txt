  2 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 25    This bill relates to mortgage releases. The bill strikes
  2 26 Code section 535B.11(5), which leaves Code chapter 655 as the
  2 27 sole standard and set of remedies.
  2 28    The bill amends Code section 655.1 to require that within  30
  2 29 days of a mortgagor fully paying off a mortgage, a mortgagee

  3  5 of $500 and to allow reasonable attorney fees to be awarded
  3  6 in addition to rather than included in, actual damages,
  3  7 where a mortgagee, or a mortgagee's personal representative
  3  8 or assignee, upon full performance of the conditions of the
  3  9 mortgage, fails to discharge such mortgage as set forth in
  3 10 Code section 655.1. The bill eliminates an authorization that
  3 11 provides that if the defendant is not a resident of this state,
  3 12 such action may be maintained upon the expiration of 30 days
  3 13 after the conditions of the mortgage have been performed,
  3 14 without such previous request of tender.
  3 15    The bill also amends Code section 655.5 to increase the
  3 16 penalty from $100 to $500 if a mortgagee fails to file a
  3 17 satisfaction of judgment within 30 days of receiving a written
  3 18 request.

  3 22 reasonable procedures to achieve compliance with its
  3 23 obligations under Code section 655.3; the mortgagee complied
  3 24 with that procedure in good faith; and the mortgagee was unable
