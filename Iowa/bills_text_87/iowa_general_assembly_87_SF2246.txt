  2 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  2 31 Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, complex regional

  2 35 by the department of public health pursuant to rule to the
  3  1 definition of "debilitating medical condition" for which the
  3  2 use of medical cannabidiol would be medically beneficial. The
  3  3 bill also removes the requirement that multiple sclerosis
  3  4 be accompanied by severe and persistent muscle spasms to be
  3  5 considered a debilitating medical condition.
  3  6    The bill alters the definition of medical cannabidiol.
  3  7 The bill requires the medical cannabidiol board to make
  3  8 recommendations regarding the alteration of the list of
  3  9 debilitating medical conditions for which the use of medical
  3 10 cannabidiol would be medically beneficial and the form and
  3 11 quantity in which medical cannabidiol may be dispensed to the
