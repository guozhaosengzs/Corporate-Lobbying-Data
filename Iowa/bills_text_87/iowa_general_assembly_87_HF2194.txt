  8  4                           EXPLANATION
  8  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  7    This bill relates to sexually violent predators, the
  8  8 accumulation of earned time by offenders, and providing
  8  9 penalties.
  8 10    The bill strikes a provision permitting a person committed
  8 11 as a sexually violent predator under Code chapter 229A
  8 12 (committed person) to be released from a secure facility or a
  8 13 transitional release program without supervision.  Currently, a
  8 14 committed person may be released with or without supervision.
  8 15    Current law provides that a final hearing on the status of
  8 16 the committed person shall be held if a committed person shows
  8 17 by a preponderance of the evidence that such a final hearing
  8 18 should be held to determine either the mental abnormality
  8 19 of the committed person has so changed that the person is
  8 20 not likely to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually
  8 21 violent offenses or the committed person is suitable for
  8 22 placement in a transitional release program.
  8 23    If the committed person proves by a preponderance of the
  8 24 evidence that a final hearing should be held, current law
  8 25 requires the court to set the final hearing within 60 days of
  8 26 that determination. After the court's determination that a
  8 27 final hearing should be held, the bill permits the committed

  8 34    Currently, a committed person may be released to a
  8 35 transitional release program. If the committed person absconds
  9  1 from the transitional release program, current law requires
  9  2 the court to set a hearing within five days of the committed
  9  3 person's return to a secure facility in order to determine if a
  9  4 violation occurred.  The bill strikes the requirement that such
  9  5 a hearing be held within five days of the committed person's
  9  6 return to a secure facility.
  9  7    Under the bill, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9  8 committed person should be released from a secure facility or a
  9  9 transitional release program, but the court has determined the
  9 10 committed person suffers from a mental abnormality and it is
  9 11 in the best interest of the community, the court shall release
  9 12 the committed person with supervision prior to discharge.
  9 13 Under current law, if the court or jury has determined that a

  9 17 court determines it is in the best interests of the community.
  9 18    If a committed person is released with supervision, the
  9 19 bill specifies that a judicial district of department of
  9 20 correctional services shall not be held liable for any acts
  9 21 of the committed person.  Currently, the department of human
  9 22 services is the only designated agency that is not liable for
  9 23 the acts of a committed person released with supervision.
  9 24    If a person is released with supervision, and the person

  9 30 the committed person or victim impact statements which have
  9 31 been submitted to the court or admitted into evidence shall
  9 32 be sealed and opened only upon order of the court. The bill
  9 33 specifies that the documents under seal shall be made available

 10 15 a domestic abuse treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10 16 any reduction of a category "B" sentence until the inmate
 10 17 participates in and completes a domestic abuse treatment

  8 31 may reassert a demand that a final hearing be held within 60
  8 32 days from the date of filing the demand with the clerk of the
  8 33 district court.
  8 34    Currently, a committed person may be released to a
  8 35 transitional release program. If the committed person absconds
  9  1 from the transitional release program, current law requires
  9  2 the court to set a hearing within five days of the committed
  9  3 person's return to a secure facility in order to determine if a
  9  4 violation occurred.  The bill strikes the requirement that such
  9  5 a hearing be held within five days of the committed person's
  9  6 return to a secure facility.
  9  7    Under the bill, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9  8 committed person should be released from a secure facility or a
  9  9 transitional release program, but the court has determined the
  9 10 committed person suffers from a mental abnormality and it is
  9 11 in the best interest of the community, the court shall release
  9 12 the committed person with supervision prior to discharge.
  9 13 Under current law, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9 14 committed person should be discharged from the sexually violent
  9 15 predator program, the court may release the committed person
  9 16 with or without supervision prior to such discharge if the
  9 17 court determines it is in the best interests of the community.
  9 18    If a committed person is released with supervision, the
  9 19 bill specifies that a judicial district of department of
  9 20 correctional services shall not be held liable for any acts
  9 21 of the committed person.  Currently, the department of human
  9 22 services is the only designated agency that is not liable for
  9 23 the acts of a committed person released with supervision.
  9 24    If a person is released with supervision, and the person
  9 25 absconds in violation of the release plan, the bill strikes
  9 26 the requirement that a hearing be held within five days of the
  9 27 committed person's return to a secure facility in order to
  9 28 determine if a violation occurred.
  9 29    Under current law, any medical or treatment reports of
  9 30 the committed person or victim impact statements which have
  9 31 been submitted to the court or admitted into evidence shall
  9 32 be sealed and opened only upon order of the court. The bill
  9 33 specifies that the documents under seal shall be made available
  9 34 to the prosecuting attorney, attorney general, committed
  9 35 person, or attorney for the committed person without a court
 10  1 order.
 10  2    The bill specifies that an inmate committed to the
 10  3 department of corrections who is required to participate in
 10  4 a sex offender treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10  5 any reduction of a category "A" sentence until the inmate
 10  6 participates in and completes a sex offender treatment program.
 10  7 Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a reduction of
 10  8 sentence unless the inmate participates in and completes a
 10  9 sex offender treatment program.  An inmate serving a category
 10 10 "A" sentence is eligible to receive one and two=tenths
 10 11 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 10 12 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement status.
 10 13    The bill specifies that an inmate committed to the
 10 14 department of corrections who is required to participate in
 10 15 a domestic abuse treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10 16 any reduction of a category "B" sentence until the inmate
 10 17 participates in and completes a domestic abuse treatment
 10 18 program.  Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a
 10 19 reduction of sentence unless the inmate participates in and
 10 20 completes a domestic abuse treatment program. An inmate
 10 21 serving a category "B" sentence is eligible for a reduction of
 10 22 sentence equal to fifteen eighty=fifths of a day for each day
 10 23 of good conduct by the inmate.
 10 24    Upon a finding of an independent administrative law judge,
 10 25 the bill specifies that an inmate committed to the department
 10 26 of corrections may be ordered to forfeit any or all earned
 10 27 time, if the inmate has failed to complete a sex offender or
 10 28 domestic abuse treatment program as specified in Code section

  8  1 of time that should be forfeited based upon the severity of the
  8  2 violation. Prior violations by the inmate may be considered by

  8  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  7    This bill relates to sexually violent predators, the
  8  8 accumulation of earned time by offenders, and providing
  8  9 penalties.
  8 10    The bill strikes a provision permitting a person committed
  8 11 as a sexually violent predator under Code chapter 229A
  8 12 (committed person) to be released from a secure facility or a
  8 13 transitional release program without supervision.  Currently, a
  8 14 committed person may be released with or without supervision.
  8 15    Current law provides that a final hearing on the status of
  8 16 the committed person shall be held if a committed person shows
  8 17 by a preponderance of the evidence that such a final hearing
  8 18 should be held to determine either the mental abnormality
  8 19 of the committed person has so changed that the person is
  8 20 not likely to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually
  8 21 violent offenses or the committed person is suitable for
  8 22 placement in a transitional release program.
  8 23    If the committed person proves by a preponderance of the
  8 24 evidence that a final hearing should be held, current law
  8 25 requires the court to set the final hearing within 60 days of
  8 26 that determination. After the court's determination that a
  8 27 final hearing should be held, the bill permits the committed
  8 28 person to waive the requirement that a final hearing be held

  9 13 Under current law, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9 14 committed person should be discharged from the sexually violent
  9 15 predator program, the court may release the committed person
  9 16 with or without supervision prior to such discharge if the
  9 17 court determines it is in the best interests of the community.
  9 18    If a committed person is released with supervision, the
  9 19 bill specifies that a judicial district of department of
  9 20 correctional services shall not be held liable for any acts
  9 21 of the committed person.  Currently, the department of human
  9 22 services is the only designated agency that is not liable for
  9 23 the acts of a committed person released with supervision.
  9 24    If a person is released with supervision, and the person
  9 25 absconds in violation of the release plan, the bill strikes
  9 26 the requirement that a hearing be held within five days of the
  9 27 committed person's return to a secure facility in order to
  9 28 determine if a violation occurred.
  9 29    Under current law, any medical or treatment reports of
  9 30 the committed person or victim impact statements which have
  9 31 been submitted to the court or admitted into evidence shall
  9 32 be sealed and opened only upon order of the court. The bill
  9 33 specifies that the documents under seal shall be made available
  9 34 to the prosecuting attorney, attorney general, committed
  9 35 person, or attorney for the committed person without a court
 10  1 order.
 10  2    The bill specifies that an inmate committed to the

 10  4 a sex offender treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10  5 any reduction of a category "A" sentence until the inmate
 10  6 participates in and completes a sex offender treatment program.
 10  7 Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a reduction of
 10  8 sentence unless the inmate participates in and completes a
 10  9 sex offender treatment program.  An inmate serving a category
 10 10 "A" sentence is eligible to receive one and two=tenths
 10 11 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 10 12 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement status.
 10 13    The bill specifies that an inmate committed to the
 10 14 department of corrections who is required to participate in
 10 15 a domestic abuse treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10 16 any reduction of a category "B" sentence until the inmate
 10 17 participates in and completes a domestic abuse treatment
 10 18 program.  Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a
 10 19 reduction of sentence unless the inmate participates in and
 10 20 completes a domestic abuse treatment program. An inmate
 10 21 serving a category "B" sentence is eligible for a reduction of
 10 22 sentence equal to fifteen eighty=fifths of a day for each day
 10 23 of good conduct by the inmate.
 10 24    Upon a finding of an independent administrative law judge,
 10 25 the bill specifies that an inmate committed to the department
 10 26 of corrections may be ordered to forfeit any or all earned
 10 27 time, if the inmate has failed to complete a sex offender or
 10 28 domestic abuse treatment program as specified in Code section
 10 29 903A.2.

  8  4                           EXPLANATION
  8  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  7    This bill relates to sexually violent predators, the
  8  8 accumulation of earned time by offenders, and providing
  8  9 penalties.
  8 10    The bill strikes a provision permitting a person committed
  8 11 as a sexually violent predator under Code chapter 229A
  8 12 (committed person) to be released from a secure facility or a
  8 13 transitional release program without supervision.  Currently, a
  8 14 committed person may be released with or without supervision.
  8 15    Current law provides that a final hearing on the status of
  8 16 the committed person shall be held if a committed person shows
  8 17 by a preponderance of the evidence that such a final hearing
  8 18 should be held to determine either the mental abnormality
  8 19 of the committed person has so changed that the person is
  8 20 not likely to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually
  8 21 violent offenses or the committed person is suitable for
  8 22 placement in a transitional release program.
  8 23    If the committed person proves by a preponderance of the
  8 24 evidence that a final hearing should be held, current law
  8 25 requires the court to set the final hearing within 60 days of
  8 26 that determination. After the court's determination that a
  8 27 final hearing should be held, the bill permits the committed
  8 28 person to waive the requirement that a final hearing be held
  8 29 within 60 days of the court's determination; however, the
  8 30 committed person or the attorney for the committed person
  8 31 may reassert a demand that a final hearing be held within 60
  8 32 days from the date of filing the demand with the clerk of the
  8 33 district court.
  8 34    Currently, a committed person may be released to a
  8 35 transitional release program. If the committed person absconds
  9  1 from the transitional release program, current law requires
  9  2 the court to set a hearing within five days of the committed
  9  3 person's return to a secure facility in order to determine if a
  9  4 violation occurred.  The bill strikes the requirement that such
  9  5 a hearing be held within five days of the committed person's
  9  6 return to a secure facility.
  9  7    Under the bill, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9  8 committed person should be released from a secure facility or a
  9  9 transitional release program, but the court has determined the
  9 10 committed person suffers from a mental abnormality and it is
  9 11 in the best interest of the community, the court shall release
  9 12 the committed person with supervision prior to discharge.
  9 13 Under current law, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9 14 committed person should be discharged from the sexually violent
  9 15 predator program, the court may release the committed person
  9 16 with or without supervision prior to such discharge if the
  9 17 court determines it is in the best interests of the community.
  9 18    If a committed person is released with supervision, the
  9 19 bill specifies that a judicial district of department of
  9 20 correctional services shall not be held liable for any acts
  9 21 of the committed person.  Currently, the department of human

  9 23 the acts of a committed person released with supervision.
  9 24    If a person is released with supervision, and the person
  9 25 absconds in violation of the release plan, the bill strikes
  9 26 the requirement that a hearing be held within five days of the
  9 27 committed person's return to a secure facility in order to

 10  7 Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a reduction of
 10  8 sentence unless the inmate participates in and completes a
 10  9 sex offender treatment program.  An inmate serving a category
 10 10 "A" sentence is eligible to receive one and two=tenths
 10 11 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 10 12 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement status.
 10 13    The bill specifies that an inmate committed to the
 10 14 department of corrections who is required to participate in
 10 15 a domestic abuse treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10 16 any reduction of a category "B" sentence until the inmate
 10 17 participates in and completes a domestic abuse treatment
 10 18 program.  Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a

  8  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  7    This bill relates to sexually violent predators, the
  8  8 accumulation of earned time by offenders, and providing
  8  9 penalties.
  8 10    The bill strikes a provision permitting a person committed
  8 11 as a sexually violent predator under Code chapter 229A
  8 12 (committed person) to be released from a secure facility or a
  8 13 transitional release program without supervision.  Currently, a
  8 14 committed person may be released with or without supervision.
  8 15    Current law provides that a final hearing on the status of
  8 16 the committed person shall be held if a committed person shows
  8 17 by a preponderance of the evidence that such a final hearing
  8 18 should be held to determine either the mental abnormality
  8 19 of the committed person has so changed that the person is
  8 20 not likely to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually
  8 21 violent offenses or the committed person is suitable for
  8 22 placement in a transitional release program.
  8 23    If the committed person proves by a preponderance of the
  8 24 evidence that a final hearing should be held, current law
  8 25 requires the court to set the final hearing within 60 days of
  8 26 that determination. After the court's determination that a
  8 27 final hearing should be held, the bill permits the committed
  8 28 person to waive the requirement that a final hearing be held
  8 29 within 60 days of the court's determination; however, the
  8 30 committed person or the attorney for the committed person
  8 31 may reassert a demand that a final hearing be held within 60
  8 32 days from the date of filing the demand with the clerk of the
  8 33 district court.
  8 34    Currently, a committed person may be released to a
  8 35 transitional release program. If the committed person absconds
  9  1 from the transitional release program, current law requires
  9  2 the court to set a hearing within five days of the committed
  9  3 person's return to a secure facility in order to determine if a
  9  4 violation occurred.  The bill strikes the requirement that such
  9  5 a hearing be held within five days of the committed person's
  9  6 return to a secure facility.
  9  7    Under the bill, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9  8 committed person should be released from a secure facility or a
  9  9 transitional release program, but the court has determined the
  9 10 committed person suffers from a mental abnormality and it is
  9 11 in the best interest of the community, the court shall release
  9 12 the committed person with supervision prior to discharge.
  9 13 Under current law, if the court or jury has determined that a
  9 14 committed person should be discharged from the sexually violent
  9 15 predator program, the court may release the committed person
  9 16 with or without supervision prior to such discharge if the
  9 17 court determines it is in the best interests of the community.
  9 18    If a committed person is released with supervision, the
  9 19 bill specifies that a judicial district of department of
  9 20 correctional services shall not be held liable for any acts
  9 21 of the committed person.  Currently, the department of human
  9 22 services is the only designated agency that is not liable for
  9 23 the acts of a committed person released with supervision.
  9 24    If a person is released with supervision, and the person
  9 25 absconds in violation of the release plan, the bill strikes
  9 26 the requirement that a hearing be held within five days of the
  9 27 committed person's return to a secure facility in order to
  9 28 determine if a violation occurred.
  9 29    Under current law, any medical or treatment reports of
  9 30 the committed person or victim impact statements which have
  9 31 been submitted to the court or admitted into evidence shall
  9 32 be sealed and opened only upon order of the court. The bill
  9 33 specifies that the documents under seal shall be made available
  9 34 to the prosecuting attorney, attorney general, committed
  9 35 person, or attorney for the committed person without a court
 10  1 order.
 10  2    The bill specifies that an inmate committed to the
 10  3 department of corrections who is required to participate in
 10  4 a sex offender treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10  5 any reduction of a category "A" sentence until the inmate
 10  6 participates in and completes a sex offender treatment program.
 10  7 Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a reduction of
 10  8 sentence unless the inmate participates in and completes a
 10  9 sex offender treatment program.  An inmate serving a category
 10 10 "A" sentence is eligible to receive one and two=tenths
 10 11 days for each day the inmate demonstrates good conduct and
 10 12 satisfactorily participates in any program or placement status.
 10 13    The bill specifies that an inmate committed to the
 10 14 department of corrections who is required to participate in
 10 15 a domestic abuse treatment program shall not be eligible for
 10 16 any reduction of a category "B" sentence until the inmate
 10 17 participates in and completes a domestic abuse treatment
 10 18 program.  Currently, such an inmate is not eligible for a
 10 19 reduction of sentence unless the inmate participates in and

 10 21 serving a category "B" sentence is eligible for a reduction of
 10 22 sentence equal to fifteen eighty=fifths of a day for each day
