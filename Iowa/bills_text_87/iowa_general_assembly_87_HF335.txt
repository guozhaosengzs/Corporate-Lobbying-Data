  5  1 recreational use area upon the owner's private lands or waters
  5  2 shall be entitled to the tax credit and other benefits provided
  5  3 in the bill.
  5  4    The owner seeking to establish a public recreational use
  5  5 area may file an application with the county conservation

  5  7 setting forth the following: (1) the boundaries and total area
  5  8 of the proposed recreational use area; (2) the recreational
  5  9 purposes proposed to be authorized on the public recreational
  5 10 use area; (3) a description and location of the points of
  5 11 entry onto and exit from the proposed public recreational use

  5 24 recreational use area. A denial of an application for a public
  5 25 recreational use area may be appealed to the county board of
  5 26 supervisors.

  6  9 use area for authorized recreational purposes if the required
  6 10 notification, as specified in the bill, is provided to the

  6 15    The bill provides that the owner of a public recreational use
  6 16 area shall be entitled to the protections from civil liability
  6 17 and be subject to the requirements of Code chapter 461C (public
  6 18 use of private lands and waters).
