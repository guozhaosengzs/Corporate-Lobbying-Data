  4 18                           EXPLANATION
  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill relates to extraterritorial zoning by certain
  4 22 cities and the rights of eligible electors who reside in areas
  4 23 subject to such zoning.
  4 24    Current Code section 414.23 authorizes a city to extend
  4 25 its zoning ordinance two miles outside the city's boundaries
  4 26 if a county has not adopted a zoning ordinance and requires
  4 27 the city to add two members each to its planning and zoning
  4 28 commission and board of adjustment. The planning and zoning
  4 29 commission must add a member of the county board of supervisors
  4 30 and a resident of the extraterritorial area. The board of
  4 31 adjustment is required to add two members who are residents of
  4 32 the extraterritorial area.
  4 33    The bill provides that an eligible elector residing in
  4 34 an unincorporated area that is subject to a city's zoning
  4 35 ordinance is an eligible elector for the purposes of
  5  1 petitioning the city council and voting in city elections, and
  5  2 for no other purposes. Under the bill, the city council of
  5  3 such a city is required to include the eligible electors within
  5  4 the precinct boundaries of a city precinct for the purposes of
  5  5 city elections. The bill establishes certain reprecincting
  5  6 and notice provisions. For a city that is divided into wards
  5  7 for the purposes of electing members to the city council,
  5  8 current law requires that the city wards be as nearly equal
  5  9 in population as practicable based upon the population of
  5 10 the city. Under the bill, this requirement is based upon
  5 11 the combined population of the city and areas subject to the
  5 12 city's zoning ordinance. Current law also requires that ward
  5 13 boundaries follow precinct boundaries.
  5 14    The bill applies to city elections held on or after July 1,
  5 15 2017.

  4 29 commission must add a member of the county board of supervisors
  4 30 and a resident of the extraterritorial area. The board of
  4 31 adjustment is required to add two members who are residents of
  4 32 the extraterritorial area.
  4 33    The bill provides that an eligible elector residing in
  4 34 an unincorporated area that is subject to a city's zoning
  4 35 ordinance is an eligible elector for the purposes of
  5  1 petitioning the city council and voting in city elections, and
  5  2 for no other purposes. Under the bill, the city council of
  5  3 such a city is required to include the eligible electors within
  5  4 the precinct boundaries of a city precinct for the purposes of
  5  5 city elections. The bill establishes certain reprecincting
