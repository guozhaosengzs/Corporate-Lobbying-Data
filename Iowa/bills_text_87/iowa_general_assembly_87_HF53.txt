  1 14    Pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8), it would be
  1 15 a class "C" felony for any unauthorized person to violate
  1 16 a provision of Code section 124.401 involving a controlled
  1 17 substance classified in schedule I pursuant to the bill.  A
  1 18 class "C" felony is punishable by confinement for no more
  1 19 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than

  1 21    If a person possesses a controlled substance classified
  1 22 as a schedule I controlled substance in violation of Code
  1 23 section 124.401(5) as a first offense, the person commits a
