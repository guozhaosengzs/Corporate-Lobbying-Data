 11  5 of that evaluation to the natural resource commission by
 11  6 December 15 of each year that an evaluation is made. The bill
 11  7 provides that a resident deer hunting license for antlered or
 11  8 any sex deer costs $35 and a resident antlerless deer only

 11 32 in 2007 from $8 to $11, can be used by the commission for the
 11 33 purpose of those programs.
 11 34    The bill amends Code section 483A.3B to provide that all
