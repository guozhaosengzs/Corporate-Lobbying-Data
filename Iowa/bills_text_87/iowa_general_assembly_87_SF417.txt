  3 12 shall distribute and review the statement of individual rights
  3 13 required under section 6B.2A, subsection 1. A formal record of
  3 14 the meeting shall not be required.
  3 15                           EXPLANATION
  3 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 18    This bill modifies several provisions relating to public
  3 19 utility regulation and the confidentiality of certain
  3 20 information held by the department of homeland security and
  3 21 emergency management and the Iowa utilities board.
  3 22    Code section 22.7 lists public records that must be kept
  3 23 confidential from public disclosure, including critical asset
  3 24 protection plan information held by the department. However,
  3 25 Code section 22.7(45) allows the public to examine a list of
  3 26 assets made available by the director of the department. The
  3 27 bill deletes this provision.
  3 28    The bill further amends Code section 22.7 by making
  3 29 information and records related to cyber security information
  3 30 or critical infrastructure, held by the department and the
  3 31 utilities board to safeguard critical infrastructure systems
  3 32 described in the bill, confidential from public disclosure.
  3 33 "Cyber security information" is defined in the bill to include
  3 34 but not be limited to information relating to cyber security
  3 35 defenses, threats, attacks, or general attempts to attack cyber
  4  1 system operations.
  4  2    Code section 476.6(9) authorizes utilities to collect higher
  4  3 rates on a temporary basis while the utilities board conducts
  4  4 a rate review proceeding. To do so, utilities have the
  4  5 option of either first obtaining board review before temporary
  4  6 rates are placed into effect, or implementing temporary rates
  4  7 without board review within 10 days after filing for temporary
  4  8 rates, subject to the board's authority to require refunds for
  4  9 overpayment if the board later determines that the temporary
  4 10 rates were not based on previously established regulatory
  4 11 principles. The bill removes the option for utilities to first
  4 12 request board review before implementing temporary rates.
  4 13 Therefore, utilities seeking temporary rate changes may do
  4 14 so only by implementing the rates, without the board's prior
  4 15 approval, on or after 10 days following the filing date with
  4 16 the board. If the board fails to make a final decision on
  4 17 a temporary rate change within 10 months after filing, the
  4 18 temporary rates are deemed approved by the board and may be
  4 19 placed into effect on a permanent basis.
  4 20    Code chapter 478 requires any person wanting to operate
  4 21 and maintain electric transmission lines to file a petition
  4 22 for a franchise from the utilities board. Under the process
  4 23 described in Code section 478.2, a person must first hold a
  4 24 public information meeting in each county where real property
  4 25 or rights will be affected, at least 30 days prior to filing a
  4 26 petition. Code section 478.2(2)(a) requires either a member of
  4 27 the board, the counsel of the board, or a "hearing examiner"
  4 28 designated by the board to serve as the presiding officer for
  4 29 a public information meeting. The bill replaces the term
  4 30 "hearing examiner" with "presiding officer". Therefore, either
  4 31 a member of the board, the counsel of the board, or a presiding
  4 32 officer designated by the board can serve as the presiding
  4 33 officer at a public information meeting.

  3 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 18    This bill modifies several provisions relating to public
  3 19 utility regulation and the confidentiality of certain
  3 20 information held by the department of homeland security and
  3 21 emergency management and the Iowa utilities board.
  3 22    Code section 22.7 lists public records that must be kept
  3 23 confidential from public disclosure, including critical asset
  3 24 protection plan information held by the department. However,
  3 25 Code section 22.7(45) allows the public to examine a list of
  3 26 assets made available by the director of the department. The
  3 27 bill deletes this provision.
  3 28    The bill further amends Code section 22.7 by making
  3 29 information and records related to cyber security information
  3 30 or critical infrastructure, held by the department and the
  3 31 utilities board to safeguard critical infrastructure systems
  3 32 described in the bill, confidential from public disclosure.
  3 33 "Cyber security information" is defined in the bill to include
  3 34 but not be limited to information relating to cyber security
  3 35 defenses, threats, attacks, or general attempts to attack cyber
  4  1 system operations.
  4  2    Code section 476.6(9) authorizes utilities to collect higher
  4  3 rates on a temporary basis while the utilities board conducts
  4  4 a rate review proceeding. To do so, utilities have the
  4  5 option of either first obtaining board review before temporary
  4  6 rates are placed into effect, or implementing temporary rates
  4  7 without board review within 10 days after filing for temporary
  4  8 rates, subject to the board's authority to require refunds for
  4  9 overpayment if the board later determines that the temporary
  4 10 rates were not based on previously established regulatory
  4 11 principles. The bill removes the option for utilities to first
  4 12 request board review before implementing temporary rates.
  4 13 Therefore, utilities seeking temporary rate changes may do
  4 14 so only by implementing the rates, without the board's prior
  4 15 approval, on or after 10 days following the filing date with
  4 16 the board. If the board fails to make a final decision on
