 16 15 other two panel members, the panel members shall make a new
 16 16 selection.  If two such challenges are made and submitted,
 16 17 the chair shall within ten days appoint a panel consisting of

 15 23    c.  If there are multiple plaintiffs or defendants, only
 15 24 one health care provider shall be selected per side. The

 15 26 one health care provider, and the defendant, whether single or
 15 27 multiple, has the right to select one health care provider.
 15 28    d.  Notwithstanding paragraph "c", if there is only one
 15 29 party defendant and that defendant is an individual, two of the
 15 30 panelists selected shall be members of the profession of which

 16 14 If the challenged or dismissed member was selected by the
 16 15 other two panel members, the panel members shall make a new
 16 16 selection.  If two such challenges are made and submitted,
 16 17 the chair shall within ten days appoint a panel consisting of

 17  5 then select a new chair as provided in subsection 4.
 17  6    c.  To show good cause for relief from serving, a health
 17  7 care provider member of a medical review panel shall serve an
 17  8 affidavit upon the panel chair.  The affidavit shall set out

 18 27 will render my opinion without bias, based upon the evidence
 18 28 submitted by the parties; and that I have not and will not

 15 26 one health care provider, and the defendant, whether single or
 15 27 multiple, has the right to select one health care provider.
 15 28    d.  Notwithstanding paragraph "c", if there is only one
 15 29 party defendant and that defendant is an individual, two of the
 15 30 panelists selected shall be members of the profession of which
 15 31 the defendant is a member.  If the individual defendant is a
 15 32 health care provider who specializes in a limited area, two
 15 33 of the panelists selected shall be health care providers who
 15 34 specialize in the same area as the defendant.
 15 35    e.  Within fifteen days after the chair of the panel is
 16  1 selected, both parties shall select a health care provider and
 16  2 the parties shall notify the other party and the chair of their
 16  3 selection.  If a party fails to make a selection within the
 16  4 time provided, the chair shall make the selection and notify
 16  5 both parties.  Within fifteen days after their selection, the
 16  6 health care provider members shall select the third member
 16  7 within the time provided and notify the chair and the parties.
 16  8 If the providers fail to make a selection, the chair shall make
 16  9 the selection and notify both parties.
 16 10    f.  Within ten days after the selection of a panel member,
 16 11 written challenge without cause may be made to the panel
 16 12 member.  Upon challenge or excuse, the party whose appointee
 16 13 was challenged or dismissed shall select another panelist.
 16 14 If the challenged or dismissed member was selected by the
 16 15 other two panel members, the panel members shall make a new
 16 16 selection.  If two such challenges are made and submitted,
 16 17 the chair shall within ten days appoint a panel consisting of
 16 18 three qualified panelists and each side shall, within ten days
 16 19 after the appointment, strike one panelist.  The party whose
 16 20 appointment was challenged shall strike last, and the remaining
 16 21 member shall serve.
 16 22    6.  When a medical review panel is formed, the chair shall,
 16 23 within five days, notify the commissioner and the parties by
 16 24 registered or certified mail of the names and addresses of
 16 25 the panel members and the date on which the last member was
 16 26 selected.

 17  2 burden or undue hardship.  Upon such a showing, the clerk shall
 17  3 excuse the attorney from serving.  The attorney shall notify
 17  4 all parties that the attorney is excused and the parties  shall
 17  5 then select a new chair as provided in subsection 4.
 17  6    c.  To show good cause for relief from serving, a health
 17  7 care provider member of a medical review panel shall serve an
 17  8 affidavit upon the panel chair.  The affidavit shall set out
 17  9 the facts showing that service would constitute an unreasonable
 17 10 burden or undue hardship.  Upon such a showing, the chair shall
 17 11 excuse the member from serving.  The chair shall notify all
 17 12 parties that the member is excused and the parties shall select
 17 13 a new member as provided in subsection 5.
 17 14    8.  a.  The panel shall render its expert opinion within
 17 15 one hundred eighty days after the selection of the last member

 17 27 allowed under paragraph "a", the panel shall submit a report to
 17 28 the commissioner, stating the reasons for the delay.
 17 29    9.  A party, attorney, or panelist who fails to act as

 17 31 mandate or appropriate sanctions upon application to the court
 17 32 designated in the proposed complaint as having jurisdiction.

 18 22 other panel members, each member of the medical review panel
 18 23 shall take an oath in writing on a form provided by the panel
 18 24 chair which shall read as follows:
 18 25    "I swear under penalty of perjury that I will well and
 18 26 truly consider the evidence submitted by the parties; that I
 18 27 will render my opinion without bias, based upon the evidence
 18 28 submitted by the parties; and that I have not and will not
 18 29 communicate with any party or representative of a party before
 18 30 rendering my opinion, except as authorized by law."

 18 35    14.  The chair of the panel shall advise the panel relative

 19  5 upon ten days' notice to the other side, has the right to
 19  6 convene the panel at a time and place agreeable to the members
 19  7 of the panel.  Either party may question the panel concerning
 19  8 any matters relevant to issues to be decided by the panel

 19 24 proposed complaint.
 19 25    b.  After reviewing all evidence and after any examination

 16 15 other two panel members, the panel members shall make a new
 16 16 selection.  If two such challenges are made and submitted,
 16 17 the chair shall within ten days appoint a panel consisting of

 17  5 then select a new chair as provided in subsection 4.
 17  6    c.  To show good cause for relief from serving, a health
 17  7 care provider member of a medical review panel shall serve an
 17  8 affidavit upon the panel chair.  The affidavit shall set out

 15 33 of the panelists selected shall be health care providers who
 15 34 specialize in the same area as the defendant.
 15 35    e.  Within fifteen days after the chair of the panel is
 16  1 selected, both parties shall select a health care provider and

 16 15 other two panel members, the panel members shall make a new
 16 16 selection.  If two such challenges are made and submitted,
 16 17 the chair shall within ten days appoint a panel consisting of

 17  5 then select a new chair as provided in subsection 4.
 17  6    c.  To show good cause for relief from serving, a health
 17  7 care provider member of a medical review panel shall serve an
 17  8 affidavit upon the panel chair.  The affidavit shall set out
 17  9 the facts showing that service would constitute an unreasonable
 17 10 burden or undue hardship.  Upon such a showing, the chair shall
 17 11 excuse the member from serving.  The chair shall notify all

 17  7 care provider member of a medical review panel shall serve an
 17  8 affidavit upon the panel chair.  The affidavit shall set out

 18 27 will render my opinion without bias, based upon the evidence
 18 28 submitted by the parties; and that I have not and will not
 18 29 communicate with any party or representative of a party before

 29 26 the liability of the health care provider as admitted and
 29 27 established.

 31  5                           EXPLANATION
 31  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 31  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 31  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 519B relating to medical
 31  9 malpractice liability and insurance coverage in the state.
 31 10    The bill applies to health care providers, including
 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 519B relating to medical
 31  9 malpractice liability and insurance coverage in the state.
 31 10    The bill applies to health care providers, including
 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are

 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and

 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 31  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 31  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 519B relating to medical
 31  9 malpractice liability and insurance coverage in the state.
 31 10    The bill applies to health care providers, including
 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for

 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical

 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the

 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a

 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff

 31  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 519B relating to medical
 31  9 malpractice liability and insurance coverage in the state.
 31 10    The bill applies to health care providers, including
 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general

 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31  5                           EXPLANATION
 31  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 31  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 31  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 519B relating to medical
 31  9 malpractice liability and insurance coverage in the state.
 31 10    The bill applies to health care providers, including
 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,

 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for

 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any

 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care

 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed

 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the

 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on

 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31  5                           EXPLANATION
 31  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 31  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 31  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 519B relating to medical
 31  9 malpractice liability and insurance coverage in the state.
 31 10    The bill applies to health care providers, including
 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 31  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 31  8    This bill creates new Code chapter 519B relating to medical
 31  9 malpractice liability and insurance coverage in the state.
 31 10    The bill applies to health care providers, including
 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care

 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the

 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with

 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and

 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the

 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31 11 individuals, hospitals, and health care facilities, that
 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining

 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for

 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and

 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or

 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts

 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem

 31 12 qualify under the new Code chapter by establishing financial
 31 13 responsibility and paying a surcharge.  A health care provider
 31 14 establishes financial responsibility by filing proof with
 31 15 the commissioner of insurance that the provider has medical
 31 16 malpractice insurance coverage of at least $250,000 per
 31 17 occurrence and $750,000 in the annual aggregate.  Health care
 31 18 providers that are hospitals or health care facilities are
 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for

 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an

 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have

 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and

 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the

 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care

 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31 19 subject to different amounts based on the number of beds.
 31 20 Financial responsibility can also be established by filing and
 31 21 maintaining a surety bond, or if the provider is a hospital, by
 31 22 submitting a verified financial statement.
 31 23    Beginning January 1, 2018, the bill provides that an annual
 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and

 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the

 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 31 24 surcharge shall be assessed on all health care providers that
 31 25 seek to qualify under new Code chapter 519B in the state to
 31 26 create a source of moneys for a patient compensation fund.
 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care

 31 27 Beginning January 1, 2018, the amount of the annual surcharge
 31 28 is 100 percent of the cost to each provider of maintaining
 31 29 financial responsibility except that surcharges assessed
 31 30 against physicians and hospitals are based on calculations
 31 31 of actuarial risk.  Beginning January 1, 2020, the annual
 31 32 surcharge is to be set by rules adopted by the commissioner
 31 33 that meet specified requirements.  The surcharge is collected
 31 34 on the same basis as premiums by each medical malpractice
 31 35 insurer and remitted by each insurer to the commissioner for
 32  1 deposit into the patient compensation fund.
 32  2    The patient compensation fund is established under the
 32  3 custody of the treasurer of state and consists of payments to
 32  4 the fund as well as accumulated interest and earnings.  Moneys
 32  5 in the fund shall be disbursed only for the purposes set forth
 32  6 in the bill, including reimbursements to the attorney general
 32  7 for representing the fund.
 32  8    The bill provides that a patient must file a malpractice
 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an

 32  9 claim within two years from the alleged act of malpractice
 32 10 against a health care provider that has qualified under the
 32 11 bill's provisions. However, minors under the age of six have
 32 12 until their eighth birthday to file.
 32 13    An action for medical malpractice against a health care
 32 14 provider who has qualified under the provisions of the bill
 32 15 cannot be commenced in court until the claimant's proposed
 32 16 complaint has been presented to a medical review panel and
 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem
 34 20 basis pursuant to a written agreement.

 32 17 an opinion on the complaint has been rendered by the panel.
 32 18 However, the parties can commence an action in court if the
 32 19 parties agree to forgo submission to a medical review panel or
 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may
 34 19 elect to pay the attorney on a mutually satisfactory per diem

 32 20 the claimant seeks damages of $15,000 or less.
 32 21    Within 10 days after receiving a proposed complaint, the
 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an

 32 22 commissioner must forward a copy of the complaint to each
 32 23 health care provider named as a defendant.  A medical review
 32 24 panel may be established for the purpose of reviewing a
 32 25 proposed malpractice complaint against a health care provider
 32 26 qualified under the new Code chapter.  Either party to the
 32 27 proposed complaint can request the formation of a medical
 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
 33 22    Thirty days after completing its review, the panel must
 33 23 render one or more of the following expert opinions:  (1) the
 33 24 evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant failed
 33 25 to comply with the appropriate standard of care; (2) the
 33 26 evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant
 33 27 failed to meet the appropriate standard of care; (3) there is a
 33 28 material issue of fact not requiring expert opinion, bearing on
 33 29 liability, for consideration by the court or jury; or (4) the
 33 30 conduct complained of was or was not a factor in the resultant
 33 31 damages and if so, any disability and its extent and duration,
 33 32 and any permanent impairment and its percentage.
 33 33    A report of the medical review panel is admissible in
 33 34 evidence in any action subsequently brought by the plaintiff
 33 35 in a court of law, although the expert opinion rendered is not
 34  1 conclusive.  Panelists have absolute immunity from liability
 34  2 for performing their duties.  The bill specifies payment for
 34  3 panelists and the chair.
 34  4    The bill provides that a health care provider qualified
 34  5 under the new Code chapter is not liable for an amount in
 34  6 excess of $250,000 for an occurrence of malpractice.  The total
 34  7 amount recoverable for an injury or death of a patient cannot
 34  8 exceed $1.25 million for an act of malpractice that occurs
 34  9 after January 1, 2018.  Any amount due against a health care
 34 10 provider in excess of $250,000 and up to the capped amount is
 34 11 paid from the patient compensation fund.  Payments from the
 34 12 patient compensation fund can be made in one lump sum, by an
 34 13 agreement to make periodic payments over a period of years,
 34 14 by purchase of an annuity payable to the patient, or by any
 34 15 combination of the above.  When a patient is represented by
 34 16 an attorney in the prosecution of the patient's claim, that
 34 17 attorney's fees from any award from the patient compensation
 34 18 fund cannot exceed 15 percent of the recovery.  A patient may

 32 28 review panel.
 32 29    A medical review panel consists of one attorney, who acts
 32 30 as the chair and is a nonvoting member, and three health care
 32 31 providers.  The attorney member is selected by the parties,
 32 32 but if they cannot agree, then the clerk of the supreme court
 32 33 generates a random list of five attorneys from which the
 32 34 parties strike names alternately until one name remains.
 32 35    All health care providers in the state, except health care
 33  1 facility administrators, must be available for selection
 33  2 as panel members.  Each party to the action is entitled to
 33  3 select one health care provider, and upon selection, the two
 33  4 health care providers select a third health care provider to
 33  5 complete the panel.  If there is a single defendant, two of the
 33  6 panelists must be in the same health care profession as the
 33  7 defendant.  If the defendant specializes in a limited area, two
 33  8 of the panelists must be specialists in that area.
 33  9    The medical review panel is required to render an expert
 33 10 opinion within 180 days after the selection of the last member
 33 11 of the initial panel, or submit a report to the commissioner
 33 12 stating the reason for the delay.  Evidence that may be
 33 13 submitted to the panel includes medical charts, x=rays,
 33 14 lab tests, excerpts of treatises, depositions of witnesses,
 33 15 including parties, and any other form of evidence allowed by
 33 16 the panel.  The panel may consult with medical authorities and
 33 17 examine reports of other health care providers for information.
 33 18    The chair of the panel provides advice on any legal questions
 33 19 involved in the review and prepares the panel's opinion.  Any
 33 20 party may informally convene the panel to question the panel
 33 21 about issues to be decided.
