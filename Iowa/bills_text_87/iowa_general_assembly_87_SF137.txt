  2  3 received by the school district under Code section 257.16.
  2  4 This specification of the payment of the state cost shall be
  2  5 deemed to meet all of the state funding=related requirements
  2  6 of Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state
  2  7 funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of this
  2  8 Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school

  2 10                           EXPLANATION
  2 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 13    This bill modifies the school core curriculum and
  2 14 twenty=first century learning skills and knowledge that the
  2 15 state board of education is required to address in rule.
  2 16    Currently, the core curriculum includes English or language
  2 17 arts, mathematics, science, and social studies; and the
  2 18 necessary twenty=first century learning skills include but are
  2 19 not limited to civic literacy, health literacy, technology
  2 20 literacy, financial literacy, family life and consumer
  2 21 sciences, and employability skills.
  2 22    The bill requires that the core curriculum and twenty=first
  2 23 century learning skills address music, visual art, drama and
  2 24 theater, and other fine and applied arts. The bill also
  2 25 requires the department of education to employ a consultant
  2 26 to oversee the development of and compliance with the fine
  2 27 and applied arts core curriculum and to provide guidance for
  2 28 professional development programs, strategies, and materials
  2 29 based on the rules adopted by the state board of education.
  2 30 The bill establishes that the provision establishing
  2 31 arts=related core curriculum requirements shall not be
  2 32 construed to conflict with the offer and teach provisions of
  2 33 Code section 256.11, which establishes the educational program
  2 34 accredited schools must offer and teach.
  2 35    The selection and administration of arts=related assessments
  3  1 shall be locally determined, but the department of education is
  3  2 authorized to provide model assessments aligned with the fine
  3  3 and applied arts content standards established by the state
  3  4 board.
  3  5    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  3  6 section 25B.3. The bill requires that the state cost of
  3  7 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  3  8 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  3  9 school district under Code section 257.16. The specification
  3 10 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  3 11 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2. The
  3 12 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  3 13 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
