  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not

 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate

 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the

 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  6 31    e.  Any change by a Medicaid managed care organization in a
  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,

  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in

  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the

 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid

  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,

  6 31    e.  Any change by a Medicaid managed care organization in a
  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,

  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited

  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.

  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on

 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the

 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  3  7 managed care organization shall reimburse the provider for
  3  8 services rendered.
  3  9    b.  If a member transfers from one managed care organization
  3 10 to another, the managed care organization from which the

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,

  5 35 a prescription drug or service within the following periods,
  6  1 as applicable:
  6  2    (1)  For urgent claims, within a period not to exceed
  6  3 forty=eight hours from the time the Medicaid managed care

  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet
  6 35 site and to all affected providers before the effective date

  7  7 offered, and if denied, the reason for denial.
  7  8    g.  The department of human services shall require any
  7  9 Medicaid managed care organization under contract with
  7 10 the state to jointly develop and utilize the same prior
  7 11 authorization review process, including but not limited to

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to

  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and

 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a

 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet
  6 35 site and to all affected providers before the effective date

  7  8    g.  The department of human services shall require any
  7  9 Medicaid managed care organization under contract with
  7 10 the state to jointly develop and utilize the same prior

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  3 13 at least thirty days prior to the managed care organization
  3 14 assuming such coverage.
  3 15    c.  If a provider provides services to a member for which the
  3 16 member is eligible while awaiting any necessary authorization,
  3 17 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,

  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary

  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete

  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at

  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the

  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  5 34 deny a prior authorization request submitted by a provider for
  5 35 a prescription drug or service within the following periods,
  6  1 as applicable:
  6  2    (1)  For urgent claims, within a period not to exceed
  6  3 forty=eight hours from the time the Medicaid managed care
  6  4 organization receives the request.

  6  7 organization receives the request.
  6  8    b.  Emergency claims for prescription drugs or services

  6 14 written certification to the managed care organization within
  6 15 seventy=two hours of admission of a member who was admitted
  6 16 to a hospital through the emergency department shall create
  6 17 a presumption that the emergency services were medically
  6 18 necessary for purposes of coverage.
  6 19    c.  If a Medicaid managed care organization approves a
  6 20 provider's prior authorization request for a prescription drug
  6 21 or service for a patient who is in stable condition as verified
  6 22 by the provider, the prior authorization shall be valid for a
  6 23 period of twelve months from the date the approval is received
  6 24 by the provider.
  6 25    d.  If a Medicaid managed care organization approves a
  6 26 provider's prior authorization request for a prescription
  6 27 drug or service, the managed care organization shall not
  6 28 retroactively revoke, limit, condition, or restrict the prior
  6 29 authorization after the prescription drug is dispensed or the
  6 30 service is provided.
  6 31    e.  Any change by a Medicaid managed care organization in a
  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet
  6 35 site and to all affected providers before the effective date
  7  1 of the change.
  7  2    f.  Each managed care organization shall post to the managed
  7  3 care organization's internet site prior authorization data
  7  4 including but not limited to statistics on approvals and

  7  6 medication, test, procedure, or service, the indication
  7  7 offered, and if denied, the reason for denial.
  7  8    g.  The department of human services shall require any
  7  9 Medicaid managed care organization under contract with
  7 10 the state to jointly develop and utilize the same prior
  7 11 authorization review process, including but not limited to
  7 12 shared electronic and paper forms, subject to final review and
  7 13 approval by the department.
  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider

 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on

 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  6  1 as applicable:
  6  2    (1)  For urgent claims, within a period not to exceed
  6  3 forty=eight hours from the time the Medicaid managed care
  6  4 organization receives the request.

  6 14 written certification to the managed care organization within
  6 15 seventy=two hours of admission of a member who was admitted
  6 16 to a hospital through the emergency department shall create
  6 17 a presumption that the emergency services were medically
  6 18 necessary for purposes of coverage.
  6 19    c.  If a Medicaid managed care organization approves a
  6 20 provider's prior authorization request for a prescription drug
  6 21 or service for a patient who is in stable condition as verified
  6 22 by the provider, the prior authorization shall be valid for a
  6 23 period of twelve months from the date the approval is received
  6 24 by the provider.
  6 25    d.  If a Medicaid managed care organization approves a
  6 26 provider's prior authorization request for a prescription
  6 27 drug or service, the managed care organization shall not
  6 28 retroactively revoke, limit, condition, or restrict the prior
  6 29 authorization after the prescription drug is dispensed or the
  6 30 service is provided.
  6 31    e.  Any change by a Medicaid managed care organization in a
  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet
  6 35 site and to all affected providers before the effective date
  7  1 of the change.
  7  2    f.  Each managed care organization shall post to the managed
  7  3 care organization's internet site prior authorization data

  7  7 offered, and if denied, the reason for denial.
  7  8    g.  The department of human services shall require any
  7  9 Medicaid managed care organization under contract with
  7 10 the state to jointly develop and utilize the same prior
  7 11 authorization review process, including but not limited to

  7 13 approval by the department.
  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this

  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,

  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior
  6 34 notice published on the managed care organization's internet
  6 35 site and to all affected providers before the effective date
  7  1 of the change.
  7  2    f.  Each managed care organization shall post to the managed

  7  8    g.  The department of human services shall require any
  7  9 Medicaid managed care organization under contract with
  7 10 the state to jointly develop and utilize the same prior

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this

  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.

  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in

  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.

  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on

 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.

 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.

  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to

  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this

  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity

  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on

 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.

  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to

  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  6 31    e.  Any change by a Medicaid managed care organization in a
  6 32 requirement for prior authorization for a prescription drug or
  6 33 service shall be preceded by the provision of sixty days' prior

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from

 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,

  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,

  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited

  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,

  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription

 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and

 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription

  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,

  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the

 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care

  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  5 13 human services as the managed care organization provider or
  5 14 service reimbursement rate floor for the respective provider or
  5 15 service in effect on April 1, 2016.
  5 16    (2)  For any provider or service to which a reimbursement
  5 17 increase is applicable for the fiscal year under state law,
  5 18 upon the effective date of the reimbursement increase, the
  5 19 department of human services shall modify the rate floor in
  5 20 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
  5 21 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  5 22 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by the

  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow

  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on

 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription

 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from

 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from

 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service

 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract

 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  5 25    (3)  Any reimbursement established between the managed

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the

  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid

  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract

 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;

 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 14    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  7 15 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
  7 16 enactment.
  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid

  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.

  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a

  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's

  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate

 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.
  9 16    With regard to oversight, the bill requires DHS to complete
  9 17 an initial external quality review of the Medicaid managed care
  9 18 program by January 1, 2018, and to contract with the university
  9 19 of Iowa public policy center to perform an evaluation of the
  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under

  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically
  9 14 necessary services" included in the bill across all Medicaid
  9 15 MCOs.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,

  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid

  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity

  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on

  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,

  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes

  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid

  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from

 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid
  7 21 managed care.
  7 22    Division I of the  bill amends the required benefits under
  7 23 the Iowa health and wellness plan to provide that, beginning
  7 24 July 1, 2017, covered benefits shall include integrated health
  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the
  8  2 improvements.
  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements
  8 12 or standards of practice on a primary care provider than those
  8 13 prescribed by state law as a prerequisite for participation in
  8 14 the managed care organization's provider network.
  8 15    With regard to case management services, the bill requires
  8 16 MCOs to provide the option to the case manager of a Medicaid
  8 17 member, if the case manager is not otherwise a participating
  8 18 provider of the member's managed care organization provider
  8 19 network, to enter into a single case agreement to continue to
  8 20 provide case management services to the Medicaid member at
  8 21 the member's request.  The bill also requires MCOs to allow
  8 22 peer support specialists to serve as case managers for members
  8 23 receiving behavioral health services, and shall not require
  8 24 that such peer support specialists hold a bachelor's degree
  8 25 from an accredited school, college, or university.
  8 26    With regard to member status changes, the bill requires
  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity
  9 10 across processes and procedures, including but not limited
  9 11 to those related to claims filing and denial of claims,
  9 12 integrated health home criteria, and appeals and grievances.
  9 13 DHS is required to use and apply the definition of "medically

  9 20 program by January 1, 2018.
  9 21    With regard to data, the bill requires DHS to amend the
  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
 10  8 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified by
 10  9 DHS to reflect the provider rate increase specified. Any
 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and
 10 24 prohibits prior authorization for certain emergency services;
 10 25 provides that once approval is received by a provider for a
 10 26 prior authorization request for a prescription drug or service
 10 27 for a patient who is in stable condition as verified by the
 10 28 provider, the approved prior authorization shall be valid for a
 10 29 period of 12 months; prohibits retroactive action once a prior
 10 30 authorization is approved; requires that any change by an MCO
 10 31 in a requirement for prior authorization for a prescription
 10 32 drug or service shall be preceded by 60 days' prior notice
 10 33 published on the MCO's internet site and provided to all
 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop
 11  3 and utilize the same prior authorization review process,
 11  4 including but not limited to shared electronic and paper forms,
 11  5 subject to final review and approval by DHS.

  7 17                           EXPLANATION
  7 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 20    This bill relates to the Medicaid program and Medicaid

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid
  8  1 managed care contracts as necessary to implement the

  8  3    The bill requires Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs)
  8  4 to include as a primary care provider any provider designated
  8  5 by the state as a primary care provider, subject to a
  8  6 provider's respective state certification standards, including
  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 27 MCOs to provide prior notice to a provider of a member of any
  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.
  9  8    With regard to uniformity of the program, DHS is required
  9  9 to work with the MCOs to institute consistency and uniformity

  9 22 requirements for quarterly reports to require that MCOs, in
  9 23 addition to reporting the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  9 24 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  9 25 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  9 26 the bill.
  9 27    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  9 28 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2017, for Medicaid providers
  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a
 10  3 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
 10  4 state law beginning July 1, 2017, upon the effective date of
 10  5 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
 10  6 effect on April 1, 2016, to reflect the increase specified.
 10  7 Any reimbursement established under the managed care contract

 10 10 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
 10 11 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
 10 12 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
 10 13 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
 10 14 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
 10 15 least a 12=month period.
 10 16    With regard to prior authorization, the bill provides
 10 17 that approval from the MCO shall be received by the provider
 10 18 submitting the prior authorization request for a prescription
 10 19 drug or service within a period not to exceed 48 hours from
 10 20 the time the MCO receives the request for urgent claims and
 10 21 within a period not to exceed five calendar days for nonurgent
 10 22 claims; prohibits an MCO from requiring prior authorization
 10 23 for emergency claims for prescription drugs or services and

  7 25 home services, residential substance abuse treatment, assertive
  7 26 community treatment, nonemergency medical transportation,
  7 27 and peer support.  The bill directs the department of human
  7 28 services (DHS), upon enactment of the bill, to request federal
  7 29 approval of an amendment to the medical assistance state plan,
  7 30 as necessary, to implement the provision. The division takes
  7 31 effect upon enactment, but is not to be implemented until DHS
  7 32 receives federal approval of the state plan amendment request.
  7 33    Division II of the bill includes provisions relating to
  7 34 Medicaid managed care quality improvement.
  7 35    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules and amend Medicaid

  8  7 but not limited to a physician who is a family or general
  8  8 practitioner, a pediatrician, an internist, an obstetrician, or
  8  9 a gynecologist; an advanced registered nurse practitioner; a
  8 10 physician assistant; and a chiropractor.  The MCO is prohibited
  8 11 from imposing more restrictive scope=of=practice requirements

  8 28 change in the status of the member that affects such provider
  8 29 at least 14 days prior to the effective date of the change in
  8 30 status.  If notification is not received by the provider and
  8 31 the member continues to receive services from the provider,
  8 32 the MCO shall reimburse the provider for services rendered.
  8 33 If a member transfers from one MCO to another, the MCO from
  8 34 which the member is transferring shall forward the member's
  8 35 records to the MCO  assuming the member's coverage at least 30
  9  1 days prior to the MCO assuming such coverage.   Additionally,
  9  2 if a provider provides services to a member for which the
  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the
  9  6 contracted rate for any services provided prior to receipt of
  9  7 the authorization.

  9 29 and services to be calculated based on the methodology in
  9 30 effect on June 30, 2017, for the respective provider or
  9 31 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  9 32 a managed care contract reimbursement shall be based on the
  9 33 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  9 34 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not
  9 35 be lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate
 10  1 floor for the respective provider or service in effect on
 10  2 April 1, 2016. However, if any provider or service to which a

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
 11  2 Medicaid MCO under contract with the state to jointly develop

  9  3 member is eligible while the provider is awaiting any necessary
  9  4 authorization to provide the service, and the authorization is
  9  5 subsequently approved, the provider shall be reimbursed at the

 10 34 affected providers before the effective date of the change.
 10 35 The bill requires an MCO to place certain prior authorization
 11  1 data on the MCO's internet site and requires DHS to require any
