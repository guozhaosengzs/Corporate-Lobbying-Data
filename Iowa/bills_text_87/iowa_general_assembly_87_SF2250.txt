  3 11                           EXPLANATION
  3 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 14    This bill relates to unauthorized departures by persons
  3 15 involuntarily hospitalized, including notification
  3 16 requirements, the creation of a statewide database, and call
  3 17 location information from wireless communications services
  3 18 providers.
  3 19    Under Code chapter 228, a mental health professional, data
  3 20 collector, or employee or agent thereof, is prohibited from
  3 21 disclosing or allowing the disclosure of an individual's
  3 22 mental health information without the individual's consent or
  3 23 written authorization.  "Mental health information" is defined
  3 24 in Code section 228.1 to mean oral, written, or recorded
  3 25 information which indicates the identity of an individual
  3 26 receiving professional services and which relates to the
  3 27 diagnosis, course, or treatment of the individual's mental
  3 28 or emotional condition. However, disclosure of such mental
  3 29 health information without the individual's consent or written
  3 30 authorization is allowed under certain circumstances, including
  3 31 for certain administrative disclosures to other mental health
  3 32 providers for administrative and professional services to
  3 33 the individual and to meet certain compulsory disclosure
  3 34 requirements pursuant to state or federal law.  In addition,
  3 35 the disclosure of certain limited mental health information is
  4  1 allowed to authorized family members without the individual's
  4  2 consent or written authorization in some circumstances.
  4  3    The bill allows for the disclosure of mental health
  4  4 information by a mental health professional relating to
  4  5 an individual without the individual's consent or written
  4  6 permission to a law enforcement professional to the extent
  4  7 necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the
  4  8 health and safety of the individual or others.
  4  9    Under current law, if a person placed at a hospital or
  4 10 facility or required to remain at a hospital or facility
  4 11 leaves the facility without permission or without having been
  4 12 discharged, the chief medical officer may notify the sheriff of
  4 13 the person's absence and the sheriff is required to take the
