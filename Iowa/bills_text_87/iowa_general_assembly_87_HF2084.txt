  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 ==== notice of structural failure.
  1  3    1.  The owner or operator of a confinement feeding operation
  1  4 shall notify the department of the structural failure of a
  1  5 manure storage structure that is part of the confinement
  1  6 feeding operation, regardless of whether it is a failure in
  1  7 design or construction or whether such failure may result in a
  1  8 violation of section 459.311.
  1  9    2.  The owner or operator of a confinement feeding operation
  1 10 shall notify the department of a probable immediate structural
  1 11 failure of a manure storage structure that is part of a
  1 12 confinement feeding operation, as described in subsection 1.
  1 13 The determination of a probable immediate structural failure
  1 14 shall be based on factors established by the department which
  1 15 may include any of the following:
  1 16    a.  An observation by the owner or operator of the
  1 17 confinement feeding operation that the integrity of the
  1 18 structure has been compromised.
  1 19    b.  An observation by the owner or operator of the
  1 20 confinement feeding operation that a discharge from the manure
  1 21 storage structure appears to have occurred.
  1 22    c.  A verbal or written report made to the owner or operator
  1 23 of the confinement feeding operation by a professional engineer
  1 24 based on the professional engineer's inspection of the manure
  1 25 storage structure.
  1 26    3.  The department shall adopt rules providing notice
  1 27 procedures, including when and how the owner or operator of
  1 28 the confinement feeding operation is required to contact the
  1 29 department.
  1 30    a.  The department may provide for different procedures based
  1 31 on factors established by the department that quantify the
  1 32 level of threat to water quality resulting from a structural
  1 33 failure as described in subsection 1 or a probable immediate
  1 34 structural failure as described in subsection 2.  The factors
  1 35 may include but are not limited to any of the following:
  2  1    (1)  The type and size of the confinement feeding operation
  2  2 structure.
  2  3    (2)  The proximity of any discharge or probable immediate
  2  4 discharge to the groundwater, a major water source, or a
  2  5 high=quality water source.
  2  6    (3)  Whether the confinement feeding operation structure is
  2  7 located on karst terrain.
  2  8    b.  The department may provide for different procedures
  2  9 based on whether the structural failure has caused or may cause
  2 10 injury or suffering to an animal maintained in a confinement
  2 11 building that is associated with a manure storage structure.
  2 12    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate
  2 13 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 14                           EXPLANATION
  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the owner or operator
  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case
  3 23 the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109
  3 24 and 459.603).
  3 25    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  3 26 enactment.

  1 13 The determination of a probable immediate structural failure
  1 14 shall be based on factors established by the department which
  1 15 may include any of the following:
  1 16    a.  An observation by the owner or operator of the
  1 17 confinement feeding operation that the integrity of the
  1 18 structure has been compromised.
  1 19    b.  An observation by the owner or operator of the
  1 20 confinement feeding operation that a discharge from the manure
  1 21 storage structure appears to have occurred.
  1 22    c.  A verbal or written report made to the owner or operator
  1 23 of the confinement feeding operation by a professional engineer
  1 24 based on the professional engineer's inspection of the manure
  1 25 storage structure.
  1 26    3.  The department shall adopt rules providing notice
  1 27 procedures, including when and how the owner or operator of
  1 28 the confinement feeding operation is required to contact the
  1 29 department.
  1 30    a.  The department may provide for different procedures based
  1 31 on factors established by the department that quantify the
  1 32 level of threat to water quality resulting from a structural
  1 33 failure as described in subsection 1 or a probable immediate
  1 34 structural failure as described in subsection 2.  The factors
  1 35 may include but are not limited to any of the following:
  2  1    (1)  The type and size of the confinement feeding operation
  2  2 structure.
  2  3    (2)  The proximity of any discharge or probable immediate
  2  4 discharge to the groundwater, a major water source, or a

  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the owner or operator
  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case
  3 23 the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109
  3 24 and 459.603).
  3 25    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  3 26 enactment.

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the owner or operator
  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case
  3 23 the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109
  3 24 and 459.603).

  1 30    a.  The department may provide for different procedures based
  1 31 on factors established by the department that quantify the
  1 32 level of threat to water quality resulting from a structural
  1 33 failure as described in subsection 1 or a probable immediate
  1 34 structural failure as described in subsection 2.  The factors
  1 35 may include but are not limited to any of the following:
  2  1    (1)  The type and size of the confinement feeding operation
  2  2 structure.
  2  3    (2)  The proximity of any discharge or probable immediate
  2  4 discharge to the groundwater, a major water source, or a
  2  5 high=quality water source.
  2  6    (3)  Whether the confinement feeding operation structure is
  2  7 located on karst terrain.
  2  8    b.  The department may provide for different procedures
  2  9 based on whether the structural failure has caused or may cause
  2 10 injury or suffering to an animal maintained in a confinement
  2 11 building that is associated with a manure storage structure.

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the owner or operator
  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case
  3 23 the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109
  3 24 and 459.603).

  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the owner or operator
  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case
  3 23 the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109
  3 24 and 459.603).

  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case
  3 23 the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109
  3 24 and 459.603).

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the owner or operator
  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
  3 11 A confinement feeding operation structure is required to retain
  3 12 all manure produced between periods of manure disposal (Code
  3 13 section 459.311) and is prohibited from discharging manure into
  3 14 waters of the state which includes surface waters or ground
  3 15 water sources.
  3 16    PENALTIES APPLICABLE.  A person who violates Code chapter
  3 17 459, subchapter III, regulating water quality, is subject
  3 18 to judicial action brought by the attorney general with
  3 19 a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each day of such
  3 20 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).  However,
  3 21 DNR is authorized to impose a range of civil penalties
  3 22 administratively based on a number of criteria and in that case
  3 23 the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109
  3 24 and 459.603).

  2 17    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires the owner or operator
  2 18 of a confinement feeding operation to notify the department of
  2 19 natural resources (DNR) of any actual or probable immediate
  2 20 structural failure from an associated manure storage structure
  2 21 (structure).  The failure may be the result of either the
  2 22 design or construction of the structure.  The determination
  2 23 of a probable immediate structural failure must be based on
  2 24 factors established by DNR which may include an observation by
  2 25 the owner or operator or a report submitted to the owner or
  2 26 operator by a professional engineer.  DNR is required to adopt
  2 27 rules that provide for notice procedures which may take into
  2 28 account factors that quantify the level of threat to water
  2 29 quality resulting from a discharge or an injury to or death of
  2 30 an animal maintained in an associated confinement building.
  2 31    BACKGROUND.  The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  2 32 ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act") which in part regulates
  2 33 confinement feeding operations; meaning any area where certain
  2 34 agricultural animals are confined to totally roofed areas
  2 35 (most commonly buildings), if fed and maintained for 45
  3  1 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  3  2 manure storage structures. Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  3  3 regulates water quality, and includes requirements for the
  3  4 construction of a number of types of manure storage structures,
  3  5 including those made of durable materials such as concrete
  3  6 and steel (formed) and an impoundment including an anaerobic
  3  7 lagoon, aerobic structure, or earthen manure storage basin
  3  8 (unformed). Generally, a manure storage structure must be
  3  9 constructed pursuant to design standards established by DNR
  3 10 rule (Code sections 459.307 and 459.308, and 567 IAC ch. 65).
