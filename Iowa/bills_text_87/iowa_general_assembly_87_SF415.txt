  3 21 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age, use
  3 22 of a driver's license by an underage person to obtain alcohol,
  3 23 or possession of an open container in a motor vehicle, if
  3 24 the person in good faith sought emergency assistance for the
  3 25 person or another person due to an alcohol overdose or because
  3 26 the person or other person is a victim of a crime prohibited

  3 15    This bill provides immunity from certain alcohol=related
  3 16 criminal offenses and prohibits certain disciplinary sanctions
  3 17 for certain persons who seek or require emergency assistance
  3 18 for alcohol overdoses or protection from certain crimes.
  3 19    The bill creates new Code section 701.12, which provides
  3 20 that a person shall not be charged or prosecuted for public
  3 21 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age, use
  3 22 of a driver's license by an underage person to obtain alcohol,
  3 23 or possession of an open container in a motor vehicle, if
  3 24 the person in good faith sought emergency assistance for the
  3 25 person or another person due to an alcohol overdose or because
  3 26 the person or other person is a victim of a crime prohibited
  3 27 by Code chapter 708 (assault), 709 (sexual abuse), or 710A
  3 28 (human trafficking). A person seeking emergency assistance is
  3 29 only eligible for immunity if the person, or persons acting
  3 30 in concert, is the first person to seek emergency assistance,
  3 31 provides the reporting person's name and contact information
  3 32 to medical or law enforcement personnel, remains on the scene

  4  5 has violated Code section 123.46 or 123.47 or Code chapter

  4  8 from prosecution under the bill will not face the loss of such
  4  9 person's driver's license for one year.
  4 10    The bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 is

  3 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 15    This bill provides immunity from certain alcohol=related
  3 16 criminal offenses and prohibits certain disciplinary sanctions
  3 17 for certain persons who seek or require emergency assistance
  3 18 for alcohol overdoses or protection from certain crimes.
  3 19    The bill creates new Code section 701.12, which provides
  3 20 that a person shall not be charged or prosecuted for public
  3 21 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age, use
  3 22 of a driver's license by an underage person to obtain alcohol,
  3 23 or possession of an open container in a motor vehicle, if
  3 24 the person in good faith sought emergency assistance for the
  3 25 person or another person due to an alcohol overdose or because
  3 26 the person or other person is a victim of a crime prohibited
  3 27 by Code chapter 708 (assault), 709 (sexual abuse), or 710A
  3 28 (human trafficking). A person seeking emergency assistance is
  3 29 only eligible for immunity if the person, or persons acting
  3 30 in concert, is the first person to seek emergency assistance,
  3 31 provides the reporting person's name and contact information
  3 32 to medical or law enforcement personnel, remains on the scene

  4  5 has violated Code section 123.46 or 123.47 or Code chapter
  4  6 124. Because the bill provides immunity to persons from those
  4  7 provisions, a person under the age of 18 who receives immunity
  4  8 from prosecution under the bill will not face the loss of such

  4 11 discovered consuming or to be in possession of alcohol but
  4 12 receives immunity from prosecution under Code section 701.12,
  4 13 a peace officer shall notify a juvenile court officer of
  4 14 such person's consumption or possession. Under Code section
