  1 22                           EXPLANATION
  1 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 25    Under current law, the department of transportation (DOT)
  1 26 is authorized to designate by resolution certain of its
  1 27 employees upon each of whom there is conferred the authority
  1 28 of a peace officer to enforce all laws of the state including
  1 29 but not limited to the rules and regulations of the DOT.
  1 30 Employees designated as peace officers in this manner have
  1 31 the same powers conferred by law on peace officers for the
  1 32 enforcement of all laws of this state and the apprehension
  1 33 of violators. This bill amends current law to specify that
  1 34 employees designated as peace officers in this manner have the
  1 35 same powers, duties, privileges, and immunities conferred by
  2  1 law on peace officers relating to the enforcement of all laws
  2  2 of this state and the apprehension of violators.
  2  3    The bill provides that the DOT and the department of public
  2  4 safety are required to coordinate to provide effective and
  2  5 efficient enforcement of all laws of the state, including any
  2  6 related regulatory actions.
  2  7    In 2017, the general assembly amended Code section 321.477
  2  8 to specify the powers, duties, and limitations of such
  2  9 employees. Under the terms of the legislation, the amended
