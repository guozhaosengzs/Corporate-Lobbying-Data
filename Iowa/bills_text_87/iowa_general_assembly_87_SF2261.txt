  1 34    1.  A county may adopt a special confinement feeding
  1 35 operations ordinance. The purpose of the ordinance is to allow
  2  1 the county board of supervisors to regulate the siting and
  2  2 operation of a confinement feeding operation to ensure that it
  2  3 does not impact an area of the county that has vital economic
  2  4 value or environmental significance as determined by the county
  2  5 board of supervisors.  An area may include but is not limited
  2  6 to a specific geographic location that is any of the following:
  2  7    a.  Devoted to tourism, recreation, hunting, or fishing.
  2  8    b.  Fragile or has a unique natural characteristic.
  2  9    c.  Environmentally sensitive, including but not limited to
  2 10 a high quality resource or karst terrain.
  2 11    2.  a.  A special confinement feeding operation ordinance
  2 12 shall include findings of fact that support the board of
  2 13 supervisors' conclusion that the ordinance is necessary
  2 14 to protect areas of vital economic value or environmental
  2 15 significance.
  2 16    b.  The ordinance may include greater or additional
  2 17 restrictions on the construction, including expansion, of a
  2 18 confinement feeding operation structure, or the application of
  2 19 manure that originates from the confinement feeding operation
  2 20 than otherwise provided in this subchapter, including rules
  2 21 adopted by the department pursuant to this subchapter.
  2 22    c.  The ordinance or an action taken by a board of
  2 23 supervisors pursuant to the ordinance is not subject to review
  2 24 or approval by the department.
  2 25    3.  A person shall not construct, including expand, a
  2 26 confinement feeding operation structure in a county that has
  2 27 adopted a special confinement feeding operations ordinance
  2 28 until the county board of supervisors has approved the location
  2 29 of the confinement feeding operation in a manner and according
  2 30 to procedures required in the ordinance.
  2 31    a.  The county board of supervisors may subject its approval
  2 32 to conditions for the construction of the confinement feeding
  2 33 operation structure, the operation of the confinement feeding
  2 34 operation, or the application of manure originating from the
  2 35 confinement feeding operation.
  3  1    b.  A person required to be issued a permit by the department
  3  2 for the construction of a confinement feeding operation
  3  3 structure as provided in section 459.303 must be issued such
  3  4 permit prior to obtaining approval by the county board of
  3  5 supervisors under this section.
  3  6    c.  A county board of supervisors may base its approval or
  3  7 disapproval on factors other than factors considered by the
  3  8 department when approving or disapproving an application to
  3  9 construct the confinement feeding operation.
  3 10    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate
  3 11 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  3 12                           EXPLANATION
  3 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 15    This bill in part amends provisions in Code chapter 459
  3 16 which authorize the department of natural resources to regulate
  3 17 confinement feeding operations, including by issuing permits
  3 18 for the construction or expansion of structures associated with
  3 19 a confinement feeding operation (e.g., a building or manure
  3 20 storage structure).
  3 21    The bill provides that a county may adopt a special
  3 22 confinement feeding operations ordinance which allows a county
  3 23 board of supervisors to regulate confinement feeding operations
  3 24 based on a determination by the county's board of supervisors
  3 25 that it is necessary in order to preserve areas of vital
  3 26 economic value or environmental significance.  The ordinance
  3 27 may require the board to approve the site of a confinement
  3 28 feeding operation structure, the operation of the confinement
  3 29 feeding operation, and the application of manure originating
  3 30 from the confinement feeding operation. The ordinance may
  3 31 include provisions that are more restrictive than otherwise
  3 32 provided under state law. The board may place conditions on
  3 33 site approval if the conditions relate to the construction or
  3 34 operation of the confinement feeding operation or to manure
  3 35 application.
  4  1 The bill provides that the county may adopt the ordinance
  4  2 notwithstanding provisions in Code section 331.304A which
  4  3 prohibits a county from adopting legislation that regulates
  4  4 animal agriculture and Code section 335.2 which prohibits a
  4  5 county from adopting an ordinance that provides for the zoning
  4  6 of farm structures.
  4  7    The bill would take effect upon enactment.
