 19  8     19  8     19  9 alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend the
 19 10 useful life of the facility.
 19 11    Sec. 21.   19 10 useful life of the facility.
 19 11    Sec. 21.   19 11    Sec. 21.   19 12    1.  For purposes of this section, "emerging energy
 19 13 technology" includes but is not limited to an energy storage
 19 14 facility, electric grid protection system, electric grid
 19 15 management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 19 16 vehicle infrastructure, or any other emerging energy technology
 19 17 identified by the board and consistent with the general
 19 18 assembly's intent as provided in subsection 2.
 19 19    2.  a.  It is the intent of the general assembly to attract
 19 20 the development of emerging energy technologies within the
 19 21 state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric
 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 16 vehicle infrastructure, or any other emerging energy technology
 19 17 identified by the board and consistent with the general
 19 18 assembly's intent as provided in subsection 2.
 19 19    2.  a.  It is the intent of the general assembly to attract
 19 20 the development of emerging energy technologies within the
 19 21 state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric
 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,

 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging

 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 15 management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 19 16 vehicle infrastructure, or any other emerging energy technology
 19 17 identified by the board and consistent with the general
 19 18 assembly's intent as provided in subsection 2.
 19 19    2.  a.  It is the intent of the general assembly to attract
 19 20 the development of emerging energy technologies within the
 19 21 state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric
 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 16 vehicle infrastructure, or any other emerging energy technology
 19 17 identified by the board and consistent with the general
 19 18 assembly's intent as provided in subsection 2.
 19 19    2.  a.  It is the intent of the general assembly to attract
 19 20 the development of emerging energy technologies within the
 19 21 state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric
 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 19    2.  a.  It is the intent of the general assembly to attract
 19 20 the development of emerging energy technologies within the
 19 21 state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric
 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy

 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 19    2.  a.  It is the intent of the general assembly to attract
 19 20 the development of emerging energy technologies within the
 19 21 state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric
 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric

 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed

 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 21 state in sufficient quantity to ensure reliable electric
 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 22 service to Iowa consumers and provide economic benefits to
 19 23 the state. It is also the intent of the general assembly to
 19 24 encourage the development of the state's future electric energy
 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,

 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 25 supply and the protection of the electric grid from cyber and
 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 26 physical threats.
 19 27    b.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.

 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 19 28 reliability of electric service to Iowa consumers shall be
 19 29 implemented by considering, among other things, the development
 19 30 of energy storage, and the protection of the electric grid from
 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 31 cyber and physical threats.
 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 19 32    c.  The general assembly's intent with regard to the
 19 33 development of Iowa's future electric energy supply shall be
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,

 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued

 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 19 34 implemented in a manner that advances a reliable, secure,
 19 35 economical, and environmentally responsible energy supply
 20  1 for the state, recognizing the value of emerging energy
 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology

 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,

 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.

 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in

 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed

 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20  2 technologies to promote the state's economic development.
 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20  3    3.  a.  The board shall specify in advance, by order issued
 20  4 after a contested case proceeding, the ratemaking principles
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general

 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed

 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20  5 that will apply whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 20  6 requests advanced ratemaking principles for the construction,
 20  7 investment, or implementation of an emerging energy technology,
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20  8 and the costs of the emerging energy technology are included in
 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20  9 regulated electric rates.
 20 10    b.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined

 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 11 board shall not be limited to traditional ratemaking principles
 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a

 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of

 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 12 or traditional cost recovery mechanisms.
 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 13    c.  In determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.

 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 14 board shall make the following findings:
 20 15    (1)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 16 to the board that the proposed emerging energy technology is
 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 17 reasonable.
 20 18    (2)  The rate=regulated public utility has demonstrated
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 19 to the board that the public utility has considered
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 20 other reasonable alternatives, if any, to the proposed
 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 21 emerging energy technology and that the proposed emerging
 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 22 energy technology is reasonable when compared to any such
 20 23 alternatives.
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 24    d.  The applicable ratemaking principles shall be determined
 20 25 in a contested case proceeding.
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

       gh/rn
 20 26    e.  The order setting forth the applicable ratemaking
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 27 principles shall be issued prior to the construction,
 20 28 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 20 29 technology.
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 30    f.  Following issuance of the order, the rate=regulated
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

       gh/rn
 20 31 public utility may proceed with the construction, investment,
 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 32 or implementation of the emerging energy technology.
 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 20 33    g.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 20 34 contrary, the ratemaking principles established by the order
 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.
       LSB 5362SV (4) 87

 20 35 issued pursuant to paragraph "e" shall be binding with regard to
 21  1 the specific emerging energy technology in any subsequent rate
 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology

 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  2 proceeding.
 21  3                           EXPLANATION
 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  6    This bill modifies various provisions relating to public
 21  7 utilities.
 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21  8    The bill adds gasworks and facilities useful for the
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding

 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing

 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

       gh/rn
 21  9 delivery of natural gas service to the list of works or
 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 10 facilities permitted for joint financing by public agencies
 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 11 pursuant to Code chapter 28F.  The bill prohibits public
 21 12 agencies participating in joint financing agreements pursuant
 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 13 to Code chapter 28F from exercising their powers of eminent
 21 14 domain to acquire interests in properties used for the
 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 15 transmission, transportation, or sale of natural gas.
 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing

 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid

 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed

 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may

 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of

 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 16     The bill removes requirements for the board to report
 21 17 the energy efficiency results of certain non=rate=regulated
 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment

 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public

 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference

 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 18 electric utilities and municipally owned utilities to the
 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or

 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a

 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas

 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 19 general assembly.
 21 20    Current law allows the board of directors or the membership
 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an

 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is

 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the

 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 21 of non=rate=regulated electric cooperatives to elect to
 21 22 have the cooperative's rates regulated by the board, and
 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later

 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 23 subsequently elect to exempt the cooperative from rate
 21 24 regulation. The bill provides that if the membership of a
 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing

 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric

 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll

 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall

 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,

 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 25 cooperative elects to have the cooperative's rates regulated
 21 26 by the board, only the membership may elect to exempt the
 21 27 cooperative from rate regulation.
 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding

 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 28    The bill allows a public utility to automatically adjust
 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities

 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to

 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 29 rates and charges to recover certain costs related to
 21 30 transmission, provided that the public utility first files a
 21 31 schedule showing such automatic adjustment with the board.
 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing

 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the

 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 32    Current law requires gas and electric utilities to offer
 21 33 energy efficiency programs to customers through energy
 21 34 efficiency plans, which plans must be cost=effective. The
 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.

 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must

 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.

 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the

 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 21 35 bill adds the total resource cost test to the list of tests
 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may

 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is

 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a

 22  1 the board must apply in determining the cost=effectiveness of
 22  2 energy efficiency programs.
 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22  3    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall file
 22  4 five=year energy efficiency plans and demand response plans
 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,

 22  5 with the board, which plans shall include a range of energy
 22  6 efficiency or demand response programs. The bill provides that
 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable

 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22  7 all utility customers shall have the option to enroll in an
 22  8 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan offered by a
 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days

 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or

 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to

 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility

 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to

 22  9 utility during an open enrollment period beginning August 1,
 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 10 2018, and ending September 30, 2018. Utilities are required
 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric

 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the

 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing

 22 11 to provide notice of the open enrollment period in customer
 22 12 billing statements. Customers may only enroll in any plan
 22 13 during the open enrollment period and cannot withdraw from
 22 14 such plan until the commencement of the next five=year plan.
 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 15 Customers who move into the service area of a utility may
 22 16 enroll in any such plan offered by the utility within 60 days
 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy

 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or

 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 17 after the commencement of service. Customers that do not
 22 18 enroll in an energy efficiency plan or demand response plan
 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or

 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the

 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 19 shall not be assessed the costs of such plans, and shall not be
 22 20 allowed to participate in programs included in such plans.
 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the

 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to

 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 21    The bill provides that following the completion of an
 22 22 open enrollment period for customers to enroll in an energy
 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language

 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 23 efficiency or demand response plan, a gas or electric utility
 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the

 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 24 shall file such plan with the board no later than June 1 of
 22 25 the year following the open enrollment period, provided that
 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding

 22 26 at least 10 percent of the utility's current customers enroll
 22 27 in the plan during the open enrollment period. If less than
 22 28 10 percent of a utility's customers do not enroll in the plan,
 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 29 the utility shall commence a subsequent open enrollment the
 22 30 following year and every year thereafter until it meets the 10
 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.

 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the

 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 31 percent threshold. The bill requires the board to approve an
 22 32 energy efficiency plan or demand response plan no later than
 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the

 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable

 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.

 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 33 December 1 of the year the plan is filed with the board. A
 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified

 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 22 34 plan approved by the board shall commence January 1 of the
 22 35 year following the date the plan was approved by the board.
 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to

 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric

 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's

 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later

 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.

 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified

 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23  1 However, energy efficiency plans approved by the board prior
 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23  2 to the effective date of the bill shall remain in effect until
 23  3 December 31, 2018.
 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23  4    The bill provides that gas and electric utilities shall
 23  5 commence an open enrollment period for customers to enroll
 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the

 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference

 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric

 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require

 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23  6 in a subsequent five=year energy efficiency plan or demand
 23  7 response plan beginning August 1 and ending September 30 during
 23  8 the fourth year of a current plan. The requirements in the
 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging

 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be

 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric

 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment

 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23  9 bill regarding enrollment, filing, approval, and commencement
 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under

 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23 10 of energy efficiency and demand response plans apply to any
 23 11 subsequent plans.
 23 12    The bill allows a gas or electric utility to request an
 23 13 energy efficiency or demand response plan modification during
 23 14 the course of the five=year plan due to changes in funding or
 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified

 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment

 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.

 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of

 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas

 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23 15 for any other reason identified by the utility. The board must
 23 16 take action within 60 days after filing, or such request is
 23 17 deemed approved.
 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under

 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing

 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23 18    Current law requires the board to consult with the
 23 19 economic development authority to develop capacity and energy
 23 20 savings performance standards for each rate=regulated gas or
 23 21 electric utility. The bill replaces "performance standards"
 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the

 23 22 with "goals", and specifies that such goals only include
 23 23 cost=effective energy efficiency and demand response programs,
 23 24 as defined in the bill.
 23 25    The bill removes the outdated requirement for
 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.

 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at

 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas

 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.

 23 26 non=rate=regulated gas and electric utilities to submit reports
 23 27 to the board on or before January 1, 2010, relating to such
 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes

 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or

 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language

 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities

 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to

 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.

 23 28 utilities' energy efficiency goals. The bill also removes
 23 29 outdated requirements for the board to submit certain reports
 23 30 relating to energy efficiency to the general assembly in 1998,
 23 31 2009, and 2011.
 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid

 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 23 32    The bill prohibits the board from requiring a gas or electric
 23 33 utility to adopt an energy efficiency plan or demand response
 23 34 plan that results in projected annual costs in excess of
 23 35 1.5 percent of a plan=enrolled gas utility customer's total
 24  1 billing, or 2 percent of a plan=enrolled electric utility
 24  2 customer's total billing. A gas or electric utility may
 24  3 voluntarily propose a plan in excess of such amounts. If a
 24  4 gas or electric utility has an approved energy efficiency plan
 24  5 in excess of such amounts on the effective date of the bill,
 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.

 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or

 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of

 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.

 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to

 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board

 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology

 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to

 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 24  6 the utility may file a request to modify the plan to achieve
 24  7 projected annual costs below the amounts.
 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.

 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 24  8    Current law allows gas and electric utilities to recover the
 24  9 costs of energy efficiency plans through automatic adjustment
 24 10 mechanisms. The bill allows such utilities to also recover
 24 11 the costs of demand response plans, and requires the board
 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the

 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to

 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 24 12 to ensure that costs are recovered from all customers on a
 24 13 reasonably comparable basis, including customers who utilize
 24 14 alternate energy production facilities. The bill provides that
 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the

 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 24 15 customers that are not enrolled in an energy efficiency plan or
 24 16 demand response plan shall not be charged for recovery of costs
 24 17 associated with such plans.
 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at

 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,

 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that

 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general

 24 18    The bill strikes Code section 476.6(17), which allows the
 24 19 board to require rate=regulated gas or electric utilities to
 24 20 offer financing for certain energy efficiency improvements to
 24 21 customers.
 24 22    Current law specifies the general assembly's intent to
 24 23 provide for compatible statewide environmental and electric
 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at

 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to

 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.

 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later

 24 24 energy policies with respect to emissions from electric
 24 25 power generating facilities in the state that are fueled
 24 26 by coal. Current law requires each rate=regulated public
 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at
 25  1 least 120 days before the anticipated start of construction.
 25  2 When a facility is owned by two or more rate=regulated public
 25  3 utilities, the owner of such facility may file the application
 25  4 for advanced review on behalf of the utilities. The bill
 25  5 requires a project to comply with applicable state and federal
 25  6 environmental requirements. The bill requires the board to
 25  7 issue an order approving or rejecting a project within 90 days
 25  8 after filing. The bill removes the ability of the board to
 25  9 limit certain proposed investments or expenditures pursuant to
 25 10 an environmental plan, update, or associated budget.
 25 11    The bill allows rate=regulated public utilities to file for
 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to

 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the

 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of

 26  3    The bill allows an incumbent electric transmission owner,
 26  4 as defined in the bill, to construct, own, and maintain an
 26  5 electric transmission line, as defined in the bill, that has
 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing
 27  6 electric generating facility. The bill adds the repowering of
 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to

 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 26  6 been approved for construction in a federally registered
 26  7 planning authority transmission plan and which connects
 26  8 to the owner's electric transmission facility. Where an
 26  9 electric transmission line connects to electric transmission
 26 10 facilities owned by two or more incumbent electric transmission
 26 11 owners, each owner whose facilities connect to the electric
 26 12 transmission line may construct, own, and maintain the electric
 26 13 transmission line individually and equally. If an incumbent
 26 14 electric transmission owner declines to construct, own, and
 26 15 maintain its portion of an electric transmission line that
 26 16 connects to electric transmission facilities owned by two
 26 17 or more owners, then the other owners to which the electric
 26 18 transmission line connects may construct, own, and maintain
 26 19 the electric transmission line individually and equally. The
 26 20 bill provides that the bill does not modify the authority of
 26 21 the board or the requirements, rights, and obligations related
 26 22 to the construction, maintenance, and operation of electric
 26 23 transmission lines under Code chapter 478.
 26 24    Current law requires the board to adopt rules that require
 26 25 the board to consider the most current test period to determine
 26 26 just and reasonable rates in rate regulatory proceedings under
 26 27 Code sections 476.3 and 476.6. The bill requires the board
 26 28 to adopt rules that require the board to utilize either a
 26 29 historic test year or a future test year, at a public utility's
 26 30 discretion, in rate regulatory proceedings. For a proceeding
 26 31 utilizing a historic test year, the rules shall require the
 26 32 board to consider the use of the most current test period
 26 33 to determine just and reasonable rates. For a proceeding
 26 34 utilizing a future test year, the rules shall require the board
 26 35 to consider the use of any 12=month period beginning no later
 27  1 than the date on which a proposed rate change is expected to
 27  2 take effect to determine just and reasonable rates.
 27  3    Current law requires the board to specify ratemaking
 27  4 principles in advance whenever a rate=regulated public utility
 27  5 files an application to significantly alter an existing

 27  7 an alternate energy production facility to upgrade or extend
 27  8 the useful life of the facility to the list of significant
 27  9 alterations requiring the establishment of advanced ratemaking
 27 10 principles.
 27 11    The bill creates new Code section 476.59, relating to
 27 12 emerging energy technologies. The bill defines "emerging
 27 13 energy technology" to include but not be limited to an energy
 27 14 storage facility, electric grid protection system, electric
 27 15 grid management system, cyber security infrastructure, electric
 27 16 vehicle infrastructure, or other technologies identified
 27 17 by the board. The bill provides that it is the general
 27 18 assembly's intent to attract the development of emerging energy
 27 19 technologies within the state to ensure reliable electric
 27 20 service and encourage the development of the state's future
 27 21 electric energy supply and the protection of the electric grid
 27 22 from cyber and physical threats. The bill further elaborates
 27 23 on the general assembly's intent with respect to emerging
 27 24 energy technologies.
 27 25    New Code section 476.59 requires the board to specify in
 27 26 advance the ratemaking principles that will apply whenever a
 27 27 rate=regulated public utility requests advanced ratemaking
 27 28 principles for the construction, investment, or implementation
 27 29 of an emerging energy technology and the costs of such
 27 30 technology are included in rates. The board shall not be
 27 31 limited to traditional ratemaking principles or cost recovery
 27 32 mechanisms in determining such ratemaking principles. In
 27 33 determining the applicable ratemaking principles, the board
 27 34 shall find that the utility has demonstrated that the proposed
 27 35 emerging energy technology is reasonable and that such
 28  1 technology is reasonable when compared to any other reasonable
 28  2 alternatives. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  3 determined in a contested case proceeding and shall be issued
 28  4 prior to the construction, investment, or implementation of
 28  5 the emerging energy technology. Following the issuance of
 28  6 the order, the utility may proceed with the construction,
 28  7 investment, or implementation of the emerging energy
 28  8 technology. The applicable ratemaking principles shall be
 28  9 binding with respect to the specific emerging energy technology
 28 10 in subsequent rate proceedings.

 24 27 utility that owns one or more such facilities on July 1, 2001,
 24 28 to develop a multiyear plan and budget managing emissions
 24 29 in a cost=effective manner. The bill strikes the language
 24 30 expressing the general assembly's intent and replaces the
 24 31 requirement that an applicable rate=regulated public utility
 24 32 develop a multiyear plan and budget with the option for a
 24 33 rate=regulated public utility to file for advanced review of
 24 34 projects to manage regulated emissions from its facilities
 24 35 in a cost=effective manner. Such filing shall be made at

 25 12 approval of a tariff or rate that is optional for customers
 25 13 and all associated costs are borne by customers electing to
 25 14 participate. A tariff or rate approved pursuant to the bill
 25 15 may not change existing rates or charges. The board must
 25 16 review the tariff or rate within 60 days of filing or the
 25 17 tariff or rate is deemed approved. The board is not required
 25 18 to hold a hearing to review such tariff or rate.
 25 19    The bill allows the board to adopt rules to provide for
 25 20 a preapproval process for cost recovery for natural gas
 25 21 extensions.
 25 22    The bill provides that non=rate=regulated electric utilities
 25 23 shall not be subject to the board's rules in regards to
 25 24 deposits and payment plans for delinquent amounts owed and
 25 25 repayment of past due debt, but shall be subject to the
 25 26 board's rules in regards to payment plans made prior to the
 25 27 disconnection of service.
 25 28    Current law prohibits a municipality, corporation,
 25 29 or cooperative from considering the use of renewable
 25 30 energy sources by a customer as a basis for establishing
 25 31 discriminatory rates or charges. The bill provides that
 25 32 these entities shall not be prohibited from establishing
 25 33 rates or charges for customers that are different than the
 25 34 rates or charges for customers who obtain all of their energy
 25 35 requirements from such entities, provided that the difference
 26  1 in rates or charges is based on the difference in cost of
 26  2 service and anticipated energy use.
