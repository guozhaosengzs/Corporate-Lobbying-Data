  2 16    This bill makes changes relating to election requirements
  2 17 and limitations for the issuance of certain bonds by school
  2 18 districts.
  2 19    Current law provides that when a bond proposition is
  2 20 submitted to voters and fails to gain approval, the entity
  2 21 submitting the proposal is prohibited from resubmitting the
  2 22 proposal to voters, in any form, for a period of six months.
  2 23    Under the bill, if a school district submits a proposal
  2 24 to issue bonds to the voters, the school district is then
  2 25 prohibited from submitting another bond proposal to voters for
  2 26 a period of six months.  Additionally, if a school district
  2 27 submits a proposal which fails to gain approval of the voters,
  2 28 the school district is then prohibited from resubmitting the
  2 29 proposal or any proposal which incorporates any portion of the
  2 30 defeated proposal to voters for a period of time specified in
  2 31 the bill. The period of time for which such a proposition may
  2 32 not be submitted to the electors  shall be as follows: (1) if
  2 33 such a proposition has failed at one immediately preceding
  2 34 election at which such a proposition appeared on the ballot,
  2 35 six months; (2) if such a proposition has failed at the two
