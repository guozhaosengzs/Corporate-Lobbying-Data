  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  5 34 property taxes are paid and the special fund of the applicable
  5 35 municipality under section 403.19, subsection 2, shall be
  6  1 an amount of the property tax replacement claim that is
  6  2 proportionate to the amount of the total sum of the assessed
  6  3 value of the taxable commercial and industrial property in
  6  4 the urban renewal area as a share of total assessed value
  6  5 of all taxable property in the taxing authority and shall be
  6  6 apportioned as follows:
  6  7    (1)  To the fund for the taxing authority as taxes by or for
  6  8 the taxing authority into which all other property taxes are
  6  9 paid, an amount proportionate to the amount of actual value of
  6 10 the commercial and industrial property in the urban renewal
  6 11 area as determined in section 403.19, subsection 1, that was
  6 12 subtracted pursuant to section 403.20, as it bears to the
  6 13 total amount of actual value of the commercial and industrial
  6 14 property in the urban renewal area that was subtracted pursuant
  6 15 to section 403.20 for the assessment year for property taxes
  6 16 due and payable in the fiscal year for which the replacement
  6 17 claim is computed.
  6 18    (2)  (a)  To the special fund of the applicable municipality
  6 19 under section 403.19, subsection 2, the remaining amount, if
  6 20 any.
  6 21    (b)  The amount allocated under subparagraph division (a)
  6 22 shall not exceed the amount equal to the amount certified to
  6 23 the county auditor under section 403.19 for the fiscal year in
  6 24 which the claim is paid, after deduction of the amount of other
  6 25 revenues committed for payment on that amount for the fiscal
  6 26 year.  The amount not allocated as a result of the operation of
  6 27 this subparagraph division (b) shall be allocated to and paid
  6 28 into the fund for the taxing authority as taxes by or for the
  6 29 taxing authority in the manner provided in subparagraph (1).
  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  5 34 property taxes are paid and the special fund of the applicable
  5 35 municipality under section 403.19, subsection 2, shall be
  6  1 an amount of the property tax replacement claim that is
  6  2 proportionate to the amount of the total sum of the assessed
  6  3 value of the taxable commercial and industrial property in
  6  4 the urban renewal area as a share of total assessed value
  6  5 of all taxable property in the taxing authority and shall be
  6  6 apportioned as follows:
  6  7    (1)  To the fund for the taxing authority as taxes by or for
  6  8 the taxing authority into which all other property taxes are
  6  9 paid, an amount proportionate to the amount of actual value of
  6 10 the commercial and industrial property in the urban renewal
  6 11 area as determined in section 403.19, subsection 1, that was
  6 12 subtracted pursuant to section 403.20, as it bears to the
  6 13 total amount of actual value of the commercial and industrial
  6 14 property in the urban renewal area that was subtracted pursuant
  6 15 to section 403.20 for the assessment year for property taxes
  6 16 due and payable in the fiscal year for which the replacement
  6 17 claim is computed.
  6 18    (2)  (a)  To the special fund of the applicable municipality
  6 19 under section 403.19, subsection 2, the remaining amount, if

  6 21    (b)  The amount allocated under subparagraph division (a)
  6 22 shall not exceed the amount equal to the amount certified to
  6 23 the county auditor under section 403.19 for the fiscal year in
  6 24 which the claim is paid, after deduction of the amount of other
  6 25 revenues committed for payment on that amount for the fiscal
  6 26 year.  The amount not allocated as a result of the operation of
  6 27 this subparagraph division (b) shall be allocated to and paid
  6 28 into the fund for the taxing authority as taxes by or for the
  6 29 taxing authority in the manner provided in subparagraph (1).

  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the

  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  6 24 which the claim is paid, after deduction of the amount of other

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic

  6 13 total amount of actual value of the commercial and industrial
  6 14 property in the urban renewal area that was subtracted pursuant
  6 15 to section 403.20 for the assessment year for property taxes

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the

  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total

  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.

  6 30                           EXPLANATION
  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes

  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax

  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing

  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax

  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion

  6 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 33    Current Code section 441.21A establishes and appropriates
  6 34 amounts from the general fund of the state for commercial
  6 35 and industrial property tax replacement claims.  Such claims
  7  1 are calculated by the department of revenue based on the
  7  2 difference between the actual value and assessed value of all
  7  3 commercial and industrial property in each taxing district
  7  4 in the state.  Current law appropriates an amount necessary
  7  5 for the payment of all commercial and industrial property tax
  7  6 replacement claims for each fiscal year beginning on or after
  7  7 July 1, 2014, subject to a maximum total appropriation for
  7  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, of the total
  7  9 amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in the
  7 10 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. This bill eliminates the
  7 11 appropriation for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
  7 12 2025, and specifies that the maximum total appropriation for
  7 13 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, shall not exceed the
  7 14 total amount necessary for the payment of replacement claims in
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016.
  7 16    The bill modifies the methodology for calculating and
  7 17 apportioning commercial and industrial property tax replacement
  7 18 claims for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019,
  7 19 but before July 1, 2025.  The bill requires such claims to be
  7 20 calculated based on and paid to taxing authorities, as defined
  7 21 in the bill, instead of taxing districts as is required under
  7 22 current law.  The amount of each taxing authority's replacement
  7 23 claim is determined based on specified fractions of the amount
  7 24 received by the taxing authority under Code section 441.21A for
  7 25 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and whether the taxing
  7 26 authority is a qualified taxing authority.  The specified
  7 27 fractions are reduced over the period of fiscal years beginning
  7 28 July 1, 2019, and ending July 1, 2024, in the case of a
  7 29 qualified taxing authority, and July 1, 2021, in the case of a
  7 30 taxing authority that is not a qualified taxing authority. The
  7 31 appropriation ceases at the end of the fiscal year beginning
  7 32 July 1, 2024.  Under the bill, a qualified taxing authority
  7 33 is a taxing authority in which the total assessed value as
  7 34 of January 1, 2017, of specified taxable property located in
  7 35 the taxing authority is less than 119.51 percent of the total
  8  1 assessed value as of January 1, 2012, of specified taxable
  8  2 property located in the taxing authority.
  8  3    The bill requires each taxing  authority's property tax
  8  4 replacement claim payment for fiscal years beginning on or
  8  5 after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2025, to be apportioned
  8  6 and credited by the governing body of the taxing authority
  8  7 among the taxing authority's tax levies in the same proportion
  8  8 that each property tax levy bears to the total of all property
  8  9 tax levies imposed by the taxing authority for the fiscal year
  8 10 for which the payment is received.  The bill also establishes
  8 11 requirements for the apportionment of amounts allocated to
  8 12 property tax levies that are subject to a division of taxes
  8 13 under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
  8 14    Under current law, the legislative tax expenditure committee
  8 15 established under Code section 2.48 is required to review
  8 16 the commercial and industrial property tax replacement claim
  8 17 expenditures.  The bill eliminates that required periodic
  8 18 review.
