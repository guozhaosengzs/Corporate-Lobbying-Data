  4 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 16    This bill creates a legislative tax credit review committee
  4 17 (committee) as part of the legislative council to review
  4 18 specified tax credits.  The committee shall be composed of 10
  4 19 members of the general assembly appointed by the legislative
  4 20 council, consisting of five from each house, three from each
  4 21 majority party, and two from the minority party.
  4 22    The committee is charged with evaluating a specified
  4 23 list of tax credits and incentives listed in the bill each
  4 24 even=numbered and odd=numbered year, so that the full list
  4 25 is reviewed every two years.  The tax credit review list
  4 26 contains the tax credits and incentives listed in the most
  4 27 recent tax credits contingent liabilities report published by
  4 28 the department of revenue and not previously repealed by the
  4 29 general assembly.
  4 30    The committee is required to review tax credits and
  4 31 incentives using a public meeting format that invites
  4 32 substantial and meaningful input and comment from both
  4 33 subject matter experts and the general public.  Each year, the
  4 34 committee is required to conduct at least one public meeting
  4 35 for each tax credit or incentive reviewed, and no more than
  5  1 one tax credit or incentive shall be reviewed at each meeting.
  5  2 Public notice of the time and place must be provided at least
  5  3 five days prior to each meeting.
  5  4    In reviewing tax credits and incentives, the committee
  5  5 is required to make certain assessments as described in the

  1 25    b.  For each tax credit reviewed, the committee shall submit
  1 26 a report to the legislative council containing the results
  1 27 of the review.  The report shall contain a statement of the

  1 29 return on investment for each tax credit, unless the committee

  1 33 state by a tax credit after analyzing the cost to the state
  1 34 against the benefit realized by the state of offering that
  1 35 particular tax credit.  The report may include recommendations
  2  1 for better aligning tax credits with the original intent of
  2  2 the legislation or with the changing circumstances of the
  2  3 state, or recommendations for the imposition of a limitation

  2  5 credits, or any other recommendation for a specific tax credit
  2  6 or the program under which the tax credit is provided.
