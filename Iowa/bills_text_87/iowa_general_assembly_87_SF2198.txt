  9 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 13    This bill alters the Iowa prescription monitoring program
  9 14 (PMP) by establishing an advisory committee, authorizing a
  9 15 registration surcharge, expanding information collection and
  9 16 reporting requirements, and making penalties applicable to
  9 17 dispensing practitioners.
  9 18    The bill adds dispensing prescribers to the list of persons
  9 19 required to report to the PMP the dispensation of reportable
  9 20 controlled substances to patients in Iowa, subject to the
  9 21 same exceptions provided to pharmacies, unless otherwise
  9 22 prohibited by state or federal law. The bill also eliminates
  9 23 the PMP advisory council and creates an advisory committee to
  9 24 assume the duties of the advisory council, with members to be
  9 25 appointed from among health care professionals and the general
  9 26 public by the board in numbers to be determined by the board,
  9 27 provided the committee consists of at least four members.
  9 28 The bill provides that members of the advisory council shall
  9 29 continue to serve on the advisory committee and that any
  9 30 rule, form, order, or directive promulgated by the advisory
  9 31 council shall continue to be in force and effect until they are
  9 32 amended, rescinded, or supplemented by the board of pharmacy
  9 33 or expire by their own terms.
  9 34    The bill also allows the board, in consultation with
  9 35 the PMP advisory committee, to establish criteria for the
 10  1 identification of patients who are potentially misusing or
 10  2 abusing prescription controlled substances and authorizes the
 10  3 board to proactively notify the pharmacists and prescribing
 10  4 practitioner involved in the patient's care of its concerns.
 10  5    The bill authorizes the collection of dispensing records for
 10  6 all schedule II, III, IV, and V controlled substances except
 10  7 when the schedule V controlled substance is dispensed by a
 10  8 pharmacist without a prescription. The bill also authorizes,
 10  9 but does not require, the board to impose a surcharge to
 10 10 be deposited into the drug information program fund on
 10 11 controlled substances Act registrations, which any person who
 10 12 manufactures, distributes, or dispenses a controlled substance
 10 13 must obtain and maintain, to be used for the expenses of
 10 14 administering the PMP.
 10 15    The bill adds to the goals of the program the reduction of
 10 16 overdoses and deaths as a result of prescription controlled
 10 17 substance use and abuse. The bill also changes the due
 10 18 date for annual reports to the governor and the legislature
 10 19 regarding the program from January 1 to January 15.
 10 20    The bill makes prescribing practitioners subject to
 10 21 disciplinary action by the board under Code section 124.558 for
 10 22 failure to comply with the reporting requirement.
