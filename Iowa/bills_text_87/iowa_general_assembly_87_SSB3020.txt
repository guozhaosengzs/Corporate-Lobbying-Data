EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


BILL’S
PROVISIONS.
This
bill
amends
a
number
of
provisions
4


affecting
a
person
who
files
a
document
(which
may
also
be
5


referred
to
as
a
record)
relating
to
a
business
entity
with
6


the
secretary
of
state.
The
bill
authorizes
the
secretary
7


of
state
to
publish
a
form
for
any
such
document
required
8


or
allowed
to
be
filed.
Currently,
the
secretary
of
state
9


is
sometimes
authorized
to
prescribe
forms
for
specified
10


documents,
(for
example,
see
Code
section
490.121)
and
those
11


provisions
have
been
replaced
by
a
general
authority
to
produce
12


and
publish
forms.
The
bill
may
cause
a
state
agency
or
13


political
subdivision
to
offer
for
sale
to
the
public
a
service
14


or
product
that
competes
with
private
enterprise.
15


BACKGROUND.
The
Code
regulates
business
entities
operating
16


on
a
profit,
cooperative,
or
nonprofit
basis.
Each
type
of
17


entity
is
governed
by
its
own
Code
chapter
but
generally
18


shares
a
number
of
the
same
document
filing
requirements.
19


The
types
of
documents
that
entities
file
with
the
office
20


include
documents
providing
for
the
organization
or
formation
21


of
the
entity,
including
its
business
affairs,
the
rights
22


and
obligations
of
its
equity
holders,
and
its
management;
23


authorization
for
a
foreign
entity
to
transact
affairs
in
this
24


state;
recording
of
facts
regarding
some
extraordinary
event
in
25


the
entity’s
life
such
as
a
merger,
consolidation,
dissolution,
26


or
reinstatement;
or
amending
a
document
which
has
been
filed.
