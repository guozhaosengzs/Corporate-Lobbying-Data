  5 15                           EXPLANATION
  5 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 18    This bill creates a new Code chapter 91F that requires an
  5 19 employer to provide an employee with appropriate meal periods
  5 20 and appropriate rest periods.
  5 21    The bill states that an appropriate meal period shall be not
  5 22 less than 30 minutes during an employee's work period of at
  5 23 least seven hours.  The meal period is to be taken between the
  5 24 second and fifth hours of the work or, if the employee works
  5 25 more than seven hours, between the third and sixth hours.
  5 26    The bill states that an appropriate rest period shall be a
  5 27 paid period of not less than 10 minutes during every four=hour
  5 28 work period.  The rest period is taken in the middle of the work
  5 29 period.  The rest period is in addition to the meal period and
  5 30 cannot be added to the meal period or deducted from the work
  5 31 period to reduce the overall length of the total work period.
  5 32    The bill defines an "employee" as a natural person who is
  5 33 employed in this state for wages by an employer.  An "employer"
  5 34 is defined as a person, as defined in Code section 4.1, who
  5 35 employs a natural person for wages.
  6  1 The bill provides that an employer is not required to pay for
  6  2 a meal period if an employee is free from work duties during
  6  3 the employee's entire meal period.
  6  4    The bill allows three exemptions to the meal and rest period
  6  5 requirements.  The first exemption is if the meal and rest
  6  6 period requirements are modified by the terms of a collective
  6  7 bargaining agreement.  However, the exemption is valid only
  6  8 if the collective bargaining agreement entered into by the
  6  9 employees prescribes specific terms concerning meal periods and
  6 10 rest periods.
  6 11    The second exemption states that meal and rest period
  6 12 requirements apply to hourly paid and salary=paid employees.
  6 13 However, management or employees involved in certain
  6 14 agricultural jobs are not required to have breaks or meal
  6 15 breaks.
  6 16    The third exemption is if an employer shows that the ordinary
  6 17 nature and circumstance of the work prevented the employer from
  6 18 establishing and maintaining a regular scheduled meal period.
  6 19    The bill provides civil penalties for violating the new
  6 20 Code chapter.  An employer who violates the provisions shall
  6 21 be subject to a penalty of up to $100 for each violation.  The
  6 22 labor commissioner may recover the penalties under Code chapter
  6 23 17A contested case procedures.  Any penalties recovered shall
  6 24 be deposited in the general fund of the state.
  6 25    The commissioner may propose that an employer be assessed a
  6 26 penalty by serving the employer with notice of a penalty in the
  6 27 same manner as an original notice is served under the rules of
  6 28 civil procedure.
  6 29    The bill provides the labor commissioner with the authority
  6 30 to provide further exemptions from new Code chapter 91F when
  6 31 reasonable.  Also, the labor commissioner or the commissioner's
  6 32 designee may inspect employment records relating to rest
  6 33 periods for employees and interview an employer or employee or
  6 34 an agent of the employer or employee, during working hours or
  6 35 at other reasonable times. The bill requires the commissioner
  7  1 to adopt rules to administer the Code chapter.
  5  2    1.  The commissioner shall provide further exemptions from
  5  3 the provisions in this chapter when reasonable.
  5  4    2.  In order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, the
