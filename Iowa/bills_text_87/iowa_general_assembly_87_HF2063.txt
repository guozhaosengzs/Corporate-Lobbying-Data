 10  6 a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 10  7 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 10  8 levied against any of the following:
 10  9    1.  Property located in an urban renewal area for which the
 10 10 ordinance providing for a division of revenue takes effect on
 10 11 or after the effective date of this Act.
 10 12    2.  Property annexed or otherwise included in an urban

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10  8 levied against any of the following:
 10  9    1.  Property located in an urban renewal area for which the
 10 10 ordinance providing for a division of revenue takes effect on

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10  8 levied against any of the following:
 10  9    1.  Property located in an urban renewal area for which the
 10 10 ordinance providing for a division of revenue takes effect on
 10 11 or after the effective date of this Act.
 10 12    2.  Property annexed or otherwise included in an urban

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10  8 levied against any of the following:

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10  8 levied against any of the following:
 10  9    1.  Property located in an urban renewal area for which the
 10 10 ordinance providing for a division of revenue takes effect on
 10 11 or after the effective date of this Act.
 10 12    2.  Property annexed or otherwise included in an urban

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10  2 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 10  3    Sec. 12.  APPLICABILITY.  The portion of the section of

 10  8 levied against any of the following:
 10  9    1.  Property located in an urban renewal area for which the

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or

 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10  4 this Act amending section 403.19, subsection 2, paragraph

 10  6 a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 10  7 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 10  8 levied against any of the following:
 10  9    1.  Property located in an urban renewal area for which the
 10 10 ordinance providing for a division of revenue takes effect on
 10 11 or after the effective date of this Act.
 10 12    2.  Property annexed or otherwise included in an urban
 10 13 renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 10 14 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10  5 "a", relating to the division of foundation property taxes of

 10  8 levied against any of the following:
 10  9    1.  Property located in an urban renewal area for which the
 10 10 ordinance providing for a division of revenue takes effect on
 10 11 or after the effective date of this Act.
 10 12    2.  Property annexed or otherwise included in an urban

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in

 10 13 renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 10 ordinance providing for a division of revenue takes effect on

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.

 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,

 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt

 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before

 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under

 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided

 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 12    2.  Property annexed or otherwise included in an urban
 10 13 renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 10 14 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 10 15 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of this Act.
 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable

 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in

 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property

 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted

 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate

 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits

 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter

 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of

 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided

 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the

 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from

 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to

 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in

 10 16                           EXPLANATION
 10 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same

 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 19    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
 10 20    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an

 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban

 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the

 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that

 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective

 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a

 10 21 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
 10 22 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
 10 23 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
 10 24 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in

 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the

 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a

 10 25 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
 10 26 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to

 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 27 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
 10 28 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
 10 29 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or

 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt

 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an

 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same

 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes

 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to

 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of

 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the

 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that

 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 30    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
 10 31 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
 10 32 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes

 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of

 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after

 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the

 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 10 33 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
 10 34 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
 10 35 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of

 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger

 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be

 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to

 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from

 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an

 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of

 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other

 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the

 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,

 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter

 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided

 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 11  1 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
 11  2 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
 11  3 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
 11  4 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
 11  5 repair of such public buildings.
 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones

 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in

 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the

 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted

 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes

 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted

 11  6    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
 11  7 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
 11  8 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).

 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from

 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted

 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that

 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,

 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 11  9 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other

 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted

 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,

 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and

 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other

 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the

 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that

 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of

 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same

 11 10 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of

 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area

 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal

 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that

 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 11 11 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
 11 12 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
 11 13 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
 11 14 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
 11 15 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
 11 16 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
 11 17 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
 11 18 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
 11 19 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance

 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning

 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.

 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in

 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.

 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance

 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the

 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective

 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality

 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under

 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same

 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes

 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter

 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes
 13 24 cities and counties. In addition, by operation of law, the
 13 25 bill applies to divisions of revenue adopted by a community
 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of
 13 33 supervisors adopts a resolution precluding such a division of
 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
 14  1 Current Code section 403.19(9) imposes restrictions on the
 14  2 use of urban renewal special fund moneys for an urban renewal
 14  3 project approved on or after July 1, 2012, that includes
 14  4 the relocation of a commercial or industrial enterprise not
 14  5 presently located within the municipality. The bill prohibits
 14  6 such funds from being expended for or otherwise used in
 14  7 connection with an urban renewal project approved on or after
 14  8 the effective date of the bill that includes the relocation of
 14  9 a commercial or industrial enterprise for which the location of
 14 10 the enterprise's existing operations is two miles or less from
 14 11 the enterprise's proposed new operations location.
 14 12    The bill takes effect upon enactment.
 14 13    The portion of the section of the bill amending Code section
 14 14 403.19 relating to the division of foundation property taxes
 14 15 of a school district applies to property taxes due and payable
 14 16 in fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, that are
 14 17 levied against any of the following: (1) property located in
 14 18 an urban renewal area for which the ordinance providing for a
 14 19 division of revenue takes effect on or after the effective date
 14 20 of the bill; or (2) property annexed or otherwise included in
 14 21 an urban renewal area after the effective date of the ordinance
 14 22 providing for a division of revenue if the annexation or
 14 23 inclusion occurs on or after the effective date of the bill.

 11 20 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
 11 21 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
 11 22 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
 11 23 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
 11 24 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including
 11 30 agricultural land, including land which is part of a century
 11 31 farm, unless the owner of the agricultural land or century
 11 32 farm agrees to include the agricultural land or century farm
 11 33 in the urban renewal area. The bill provides that for an
 11 34 urban renewal area established as an economic development
 11 35 area on or after the effective date of the bill that includes
 12  1 agricultural land or land that is part of a century farm, the
 12  2 municipality shall not permit the use, development, or zoning
 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
 12 28 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective

 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
 13  7 payment from the division of revenue.
 13  8    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
 13  9 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
 13 10 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
 13 11 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
 13 12 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
 13 13 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
 13 14 357H.
 13 15    The bill excludes the school district foundation property
 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of
 13 17 revenue under Code section 403.19 (tax increment financing).
 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided

 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to

 11 25 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
 11 26 taxation.
 11 27    Current Code section 403.17(10) prohibits, as part of the
 11 28 definition of "economic development area", an urban renewal
 11 29 area that is an economic development area from including

 12  3 of such agricultural land or century farm land for housing,
 12  4 residential, or multiresidential purposes, except for any such
 12  5 use in existence on the date the area was established.
 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,

 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,

 13 18 Under the bill, the foundation property tax is not divided
 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be

 13 26 college under Code section 260E.4 and rural improvement zones
 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to

 12  6    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
 12  7 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
 12  8 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
 12  9 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
 12 10 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20
 12 11 years), or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years), shall
 12 12 be subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
 12 13 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
 12 14 the area is an economic development area and that no part
 12 15 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
 12 16 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 17 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
 12 18 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2038. If,
 12 19 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
 12 20 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
 12 21 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
 12 22 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
 12 23 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
 12 24 on July 1, 2043.
 12 25    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
 12 26 authorized for certain housing and residential development
 12 27 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a

 12 29 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
 12 30 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
 12 31 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
 12 32 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
 12 33 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
 12 34 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
 12 35 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
 13  1 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
 13  2 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
 13  3 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
 13  4 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
 13  5 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
 13  6 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for

 13 16 tax imposed under Code section 257.3 from the division of

 13 19 and paid into the municipality's special fund for the payment
 13 20 of urban renewal indebtedness but instead is required to be
 13 21 levied, collected, and paid to the school district in the same
 13 22 manner as all other property taxes.
 13 23    Under Iowa's urban renewal law, "municipality" includes

 13 27 under Code section 357H.9.
 13 28    The bill also provides that for ordinances dividing taxes
 13 29 under Code section 403.19 adopted by a municipality that is
 13 30 a city on or after the effective date of the bill, taxes
 13 31 levied by or certified for levy by a county are required to
 13 32 be collected and shall not be divided if the county board of

 13 34 county property taxes before the city first certifies an amount
 13 35 for payment using divided taxes under Code section 403.19(6).
