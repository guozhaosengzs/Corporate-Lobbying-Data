  3 23    Under current law, social security benefits received by
  3 24 a taxpayer are exempt from the calculation of the individual
  3 25 income tax.  However, these social security benefits are
  3 26 required to be included in the calculation for determining
  3 27 whether or not a taxpayer's net income exceeds the amount at
  3 28 which the individual income tax will not be imposed, and for
  3 29 which an income tax return is not required to be filed, and in
  3 30 the calculation of the alternate tax, which is an alternate
  3 31 method of calculating income tax liability for certain
  3 32 taxpayers in lieu of the regular income tax calculation.
  3 33 This bill excludes social security benefits from these two
  3 34 calculations.
