  1 23 using funds from the issuance of general obligation bonds,
  1 24 generally the issuance of such bonds must first be approved by
  1 25 the registered voters of the county.  Current law establishes
  1 26 an exception by providing that a county, in lieu of calling
  1 27 an election, may institute proceedings for the issuance of
  1 28 bonds for a general county purpose by notice and publication
  1 29 of the proposal to issue the bonds that includes a notice of
  1 30 the right to petition for an election, subject to cost and city
  1 31 population limitations.  However, if at any time before the
  1 32 date fixed for taking action for the issuance of the bonds, a
  1 33 valid petition is filed with the county auditor asking that the
  1 34 question of issuing the bonds be submitted to the registered
  1 35 voters of the county, the board of supervisors shall either by
  2  1 resolution declare the proposal to issue the bonds to have been
  2  2 abandoned or shall direct the county commissioner of elections
  2  3 to call a special election upon the question of issuing the
  2  4 bonds.
  2  5    This bill modifies the cost limitations for each of the
  2  6 population categories in order to use the specified bond
  2  7 issuance procedure by changing the amount limitations to be
  2  8 calculated based on the principal amount of the bonds rather
  2  9 than the cost of the project.
