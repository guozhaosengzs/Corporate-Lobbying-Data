  6 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 13    This bill relates to the choice of a physician to treat an
  6 14 injured employee under the state's workers' compensation laws.
  6 15 The bill allows the employer to choose care unless the employee
  6 16 has predesignated a physician as provided in the bill.
  6 17    The bill amends Code section 85.27, giving an employee
  6 18 the right to predesignate a physician who is a primary care
  6 19 provider, who has previously provided treatment to the employee
  6 20 and has retained the employee's medical records, to  provide
  6 21 treatment for a work=related injury.  The employer is required
  6 22 to provide written notice to employees of this right upon hire,
  6 23 and periodically during employment, and upon receiving notice
  6 24 of an injury from an employee who has not yet predesignated
  6 25 a physician of the employee's right to do so, in a manner
  6 26 prescribed by the workers' compensation commissioner.  An
  6 27 employer or an employer's insurer shall not coerce or otherwise
  6 28 attempt to influence an injured employee's choice of a
  6 29 physician.
  6 30    If the employer fails to provide such notification, an
  6 31 injured employee has the right to choose any physician to
  6 32 provide treatment for the work=related injury and that
  6 33 treatment shall be considered authorized care.
  6 34    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
  6 35 chosen by the other party, the dissatisfied party should
  7  1 communicate the basis of dissatisfaction to the other party, in
  7  2 writing if requested, and the parties may agree to alternate
  7  3 care reasonably suited to treat the injury.  If the parties
  7  4 cannot agree to such alternate care, the dissatisfied party may
  7  5 make an application for alternate care to the commissioner.
  7  6    An application for alternate care is an original proceeding
  7  7 and is treated as a contested case.  A party may request that
  7  8 the hearing be held in person, by telephone, or by audio=video
  7  9 conference.  The commissioner is required to issue a decision
  7 10 within 10 working days of receipt of an application if a
  7 11 telephone hearing or audio=video conference hearing is held or
  7 12 within 14 days if an in=person hearing is held.
  7 13    Code section 85.39 is amended to provide that if the
  7 14 employee has chosen care, when it is medically indicated that
  7 15 no significant improvement from an injury is anticipated, the
  7 16 employee may obtain a medical opinion regarding the extent of
  7 17 the employee's permanent disability.  If the employer believes
  7 18 that the evaluation of permanent disability obtained by the
  7 19 employee is too high, the employer has the right to obtain
  7 20 another medical opinion from a physician of the employer's
  7 21 choosing.
  7 22    The bill takes effect and applies to injuries occurring on or
  7 23 after January 1, 2019.
