  2 13 aid per pupil for the budget year.
  2 14    4.  School district enrollment supplement payments shall be
  2 15 paid by the department of education in a single payment at the

  2 12 multiplied by the school district's regular program foundation
  2 13 aid per pupil for the budget year.
  2 14    4.  School district enrollment supplement payments shall be
  2 15 paid by the department of education in a single payment at the

  2 27 257.31, subsection 5, participation in the school district

  2 29 affect a school district's eligibility to receive an amount

  3  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  8    This bill establishes a school district enrollment
  3  9 supplement program to provide additional funding for school
  3 10 districts in which the district's actual enrollment for the
  3 11 budget year exceeds the budget enrollment for the budget
  3 12 year. For the school budget year beginning July 1, 2018, and
  3 13 succeeding budget years, if a district's actual enrollment
  3 14 for the budget year is greater than its budget enrollment for
  3 15 the budget year, the district may submit a request to the
  3 16 school budget review committee for a school district enrollment
  3 17 supplement. The school budget review committee is required
  3 18 to approve the request for the enrollment supplement if the
  3 19 district meets the requirements of the bill.
  3 20    The amount of each eligible school district's enrollment
  3 21 supplement is the difference between the school district's
  3 22 actual enrollment for the budget year minus the school
  3 23 district's budget enrollment for the budget year multiplied by
  3 24 the school district's regular program foundation aid per pupil
  3 25 for the budget year.
  3 26    The bill establishes a $10 million annual appropriation,
  3 27 or so much thereof as is necessary, for each fiscal year
  3 28 beginning on or after July 1, 2018, for the payment of school
  3 29 district enrollment supplement amounts. If the appropriation
  3 30 is insufficient to make all such payments, the department of
  3 31 education is directed to prorate those payment amounts. The
  3 32 bill specifies that school district enrollment supplement
  3 33 payments are miscellaneous income and must be deposited in
  3 34 the school district's general fund. However, the enrollment
  3 35 supplement amount is not to be included in district cost.
  4  1 Code section 257.13 provides that if a school district's
  4  2 actual enrollment for the budget year is greater than its
  4  3 budget enrollment for the budget year, the district shall be
  4  4 eligible to receive an on=time funding budget adjustment. The
  4  5 bill provides that a budget adjustment under Code section
  4  6 257.13 shall be reduced by the amount received by the district
  4  7 under the school district enrollment supplement program.  The
  4  8 bill further specifies that an enrollment supplement does not
  4  9 affect the receipt or amount of a budget adjustment received
  4 10 under Code section 257.14, and, except for an adjustment to
  4 11 the amount, does not affect a school district's eligibility to
  4 12 receive an amount from the school budget review committee under
  4 13 Code section 257.31 based on an increase in enrollment.

  4 10 under Code section 257.14, and, except for an adjustment to
