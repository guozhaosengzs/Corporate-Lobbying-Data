  6 16 places the child in independent private instruction must
  6 17 furnish a report to the public school district by September 1
  6 18 stating the child's name and age, the period of time the child

  6 26    A child in independent private instruction must be

  6 35 the independent private instruction authority may be present
  7  1 when the child is evaluated.  Currently, the Code allows
  7  2 the submission of alternatives to the annual achievement
  7  3 evaluations.
  7  4    The evaluation results must be reported to the parent,
