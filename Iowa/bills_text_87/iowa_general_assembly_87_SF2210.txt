  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    Current Code section 359.42 authorizes but does not require
  9  3 the board of township trustees to provide emergency medical
  9  4 service for the township and to fund such service through
  9  5 imposition of a property tax levy under Code section 359.43.
  9  6 This bill strikes authorization for townships to provide
  9  7 emergency medical services and to levy the property tax for
  9  8 those services beginning July 1, 2019.
  9  9    The bill requires each county to establish an emergency
  9 10 services fund for the deposit of taxes levied for providing
  9 11 emergency medical services under the bill and for the deposit
  9 12 of taxes levied by the county if the county is providing
  9 13 fire protection services under current Code section 331.385.
  9 14 For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, the
  9 15 county board of supervisors is required to provide emergency
  9 16 medical services to all unincorporated areas of the county
  9 17 except for those areas within a benefited emergency medical
  9 18 services district established under Code chapter 357F.  The
  9 19 board of supervisors is required to create, by ordinance, an
  9 20 emergency medical services commission to assume jurisdiction
  9 21 and management of the provision of emergency medical services
  9 22 under the bill.  An emergency medical services commission shall
  9 23 be composed of the sheriff and four public members appointed
  9 24 by the board. The emergency medical services commission is
  9 25 required to develop, adopt, and submit for approval of the
  9 26 board, a comprehensive emergency medical service plan which
  9 27 meets the requirements of Code chapter 147A and rules adopted
  9 28 by the department of public health for the provision of
  9 29 emergency medical services.
  9 30    Using taxes levied under the bill and other funds of the
  9 31 county authorized by law for use in providing emergency
  9 32 medical services, the county or the emergency medical services
  9 33 commission is authorized under the bill to employ emergency
  9 34 medical care providers and other staff, including the cost
  9 35 of salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs, for the
 10  1 provision of emergency medical services, and to purchase,
 10  2 own, rent, or maintain emergency medical service apparatus or
 10  3 equipment and provide housing for the apparatus and equipment.
 10  4    Under the bill, in addition to other funds of the county
 10  5 authorized by law for use in providing emergency medical
 10  6 services, the board of supervisors may levy an annual tax
 10  7 not exceeding 40.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of the
 10  8 taxable property in the county, excluding property within
 10  9 a benefited emergency medical services district or within
 10 10 the corporate limits of a city, for the purpose of providing
 10 11 emergency medical services under the bill. However, if the
 10 12 county has a population of 300,000 or more, the county may levy
 10 13 an annual tax not exceeding 67.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed
 10 14 value.  However, if such levy is insufficient to provide the
 10 15 emergency medical services required under the bill, the board
 10 16 may levy an additional annual tax not exceeding 20.25 cents
 10 17 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Of all such levies imposed by
 10 18 the county, the board may credit to a reserve account annually
 10 19 an amount not to exceed 30 cents per $1,000 of the assessed
 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the

 10 26    The bill authorizes the board of supervisors to divide the

  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    Current Code section 359.42 authorizes but does not require
  9  3 the board of township trustees to provide emergency medical
  9  4 service for the township and to fund such service through
  9  5 imposition of a property tax levy under Code section 359.43.
  9  6 This bill strikes authorization for townships to provide
  9  7 emergency medical services and to levy the property tax for
  9  8 those services beginning July 1, 2019.
  9  9    The bill requires each county to establish an emergency
  9 10 services fund for the deposit of taxes levied for providing
  9 11 emergency medical services under the bill and for the deposit
  9 12 of taxes levied by the county if the county is providing
  9 13 fire protection services under current Code section 331.385.
  9 14 For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, the
  9 15 county board of supervisors is required to provide emergency
  9 16 medical services to all unincorporated areas of the county
  9 17 except for those areas within a benefited emergency medical
  9 18 services district established under Code chapter 357F.  The
  9 19 board of supervisors is required to create, by ordinance, an
  9 20 emergency medical services commission to assume jurisdiction
  9 21 and management of the provision of emergency medical services
  9 22 under the bill.  An emergency medical services commission shall
  9 23 be composed of the sheriff and four public members appointed
  9 24 by the board. The emergency medical services commission is
  9 25 required to develop, adopt, and submit for approval of the
  9 26 board, a comprehensive emergency medical service plan which
  9 27 meets the requirements of Code chapter 147A and rules adopted
  9 28 by the department of public health for the provision of
  9 29 emergency medical services.
  9 30    Using taxes levied under the bill and other funds of the
  9 31 county authorized by law for use in providing emergency
  9 32 medical services, the county or the emergency medical services
  9 33 commission is authorized under the bill to employ emergency
  9 34 medical care providers and other staff, including the cost
  9 35 of salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs, for the
 10  1 provision of emergency medical services, and to purchase,
 10  2 own, rent, or maintain emergency medical service apparatus or
 10  3 equipment and provide housing for the apparatus and equipment.
 10  4    Under the bill, in addition to other funds of the county
 10  5 authorized by law for use in providing emergency medical
 10  6 services, the board of supervisors may levy an annual tax
 10  7 not exceeding 40.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of the
 10  8 taxable property in the county, excluding property within
 10  9 a benefited emergency medical services district or within
 10 10 the corporate limits of a city, for the purpose of providing
 10 11 emergency medical services under the bill. However, if the
 10 12 county has a population of 300,000 or more, the county may levy
 10 13 an annual tax not exceeding 67.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed
 10 14 value.  However, if such levy is insufficient to provide the
 10 15 emergency medical services required under the bill, the board
 10 16 may levy an additional annual tax not exceeding 20.25 cents
 10 17 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Of all such levies imposed by
 10 18 the county, the board may credit to a reserve account annually
 10 19 an amount not to exceed 30 cents per $1,000 of the assessed
 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the
 10 25 levy under the bill.
 10 26    The bill authorizes the board of supervisors to divide the
 10 27 unincorporated area of the county into tax districts for the
 10 28 purpose of providing emergency medical services and levying
 10 29 a different tax rate in each district, but the tax levied
 10 30 in a tax district shall not exceed the tax levy limitations
 10 31 established in the bill.

 10 33 provisions of law as the result of the changes to the authority
 10 34 and duties to provide emergency medical services by townships
 10 35 and counties. The bill also requires that in order to assist

 11  2 townships to counties, all of the real and personal township
 11  3 property used to provide emergency medical service for fiscal

 11  5 the county in which the township is located. The county shall
 11  6 also assume all of the outstanding obligations of the township
 11  7 relating to emergency medical service.
 11  8    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 10  5 authorized by law for use in providing emergency medical
 10  6 services, the board of supervisors may levy an annual tax
 10  7 not exceeding 40.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of the
 10  8 taxable property in the county, excluding property within
 10  9 a benefited emergency medical services district or within
 10 10 the corporate limits of a city, for the purpose of providing
 10 11 emergency medical services under the bill. However, if the
 10 12 county has a population of 300,000 or more, the county may levy
 10 13 an annual tax not exceeding 67.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed
 10 14 value.  However, if such levy is insufficient to provide the
 10 15 emergency medical services required under the bill, the board
 10 16 may levy an additional annual tax not exceeding 20.25 cents
 10 17 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Of all such levies imposed by
 10 18 the county, the board may credit to a reserve account annually
 10 19 an amount not to exceed 30 cents per $1,000 of the assessed
 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the
 10 25 levy under the bill.
 10 26    The bill authorizes the board of supervisors to divide the
 10 27 unincorporated area of the county into tax districts for the
 10 28 purpose of providing emergency medical services and levying
 10 29 a different tax rate in each district, but the tax levied
 10 30 in a tax district shall not exceed the tax levy limitations
 10 31 established in the bill.
 10 32    The bill makes other corresponding changes to other
 10 33 provisions of law as the result of the changes to the authority
 10 34 and duties to provide emergency medical services by townships
 10 35 and counties. The bill also requires that in order to assist
 11  1 in the transition of emergency medical service providers from
 11  2 townships to counties, all of the real and personal township
 11  3 property used to provide emergency medical service for fiscal
 11  4 years beginning before July 1, 2019, shall be transferred to
 11  5 the county in which the township is located. The county shall
 11  6 also assume all of the outstanding obligations of the township
 11  7 relating to emergency medical service.
 11  8    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 11 11 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    Current Code section 359.42 authorizes but does not require
  9  3 the board of township trustees to provide emergency medical
  9  4 service for the township and to fund such service through
  9  5 imposition of a property tax levy under Code section 359.43.
  9  6 This bill strikes authorization for townships to provide
  9  7 emergency medical services and to levy the property tax for
  9  8 those services beginning July 1, 2019.
  9  9    The bill requires each county to establish an emergency
  9 10 services fund for the deposit of taxes levied for providing
  9 11 emergency medical services under the bill and for the deposit
  9 12 of taxes levied by the county if the county is providing
  9 13 fire protection services under current Code section 331.385.
  9 14 For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, the
  9 15 county board of supervisors is required to provide emergency
  9 16 medical services to all unincorporated areas of the county
  9 17 except for those areas within a benefited emergency medical

  9 21 and management of the provision of emergency medical services
  9 22 under the bill.  An emergency medical services commission shall

  9 24 by the board. The emergency medical services commission is
  9 25 required to develop, adopt, and submit for approval of the
  9 26 board, a comprehensive emergency medical service plan which
  9 27 meets the requirements of Code chapter 147A and rules adopted

  9 29 emergency medical services.
  9 30    Using taxes levied under the bill and other funds of the

  9 33 commission is authorized under the bill to employ emergency
  9 34 medical care providers and other staff, including the cost
  9 35 of salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs, for the
 10  1 provision of emergency medical services, and to purchase,
 10  2 own, rent, or maintain emergency medical service apparatus or
 10  3 equipment and provide housing for the apparatus and equipment.

  9 32 medical services, the county or the emergency medical services
  9 33 commission is authorized under the bill to employ emergency
  9 34 medical care providers and other staff, including the cost
  9 35 of salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs, for the
 10  1 provision of emergency medical services, and to purchase,
 10  2 own, rent, or maintain emergency medical service apparatus or
 10  3 equipment and provide housing for the apparatus and equipment.
 10  4    Under the bill, in addition to other funds of the county
 10  5 authorized by law for use in providing emergency medical
 10  6 services, the board of supervisors may levy an annual tax
 10  7 not exceeding 40.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of the
 10  8 taxable property in the county, excluding property within
 10  9 a benefited emergency medical services district or within
 10 10 the corporate limits of a city, for the purpose of providing
 10 11 emergency medical services under the bill. However, if the
 10 12 county has a population of 300,000 or more, the county may levy
 10 13 an annual tax not exceeding 67.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed
 10 14 value.  However, if such levy is insufficient to provide the
 10 15 emergency medical services required under the bill, the board
 10 16 may levy an additional annual tax not exceeding 20.25 cents
 10 17 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Of all such levies imposed by
 10 18 the county, the board may credit to a reserve account annually
 10 19 an amount not to exceed 30 cents per $1,000 of the assessed
 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the
 10 25 levy under the bill.
 10 26    The bill authorizes the board of supervisors to divide the
 10 27 unincorporated area of the county into tax districts for the
 10 28 purpose of providing emergency medical services and levying
 10 29 a different tax rate in each district, but the tax levied
 10 30 in a tax district shall not exceed the tax levy limitations
 10 31 established in the bill.
 10 32    The bill makes other corresponding changes to other
 10 33 provisions of law as the result of the changes to the authority
 10 34 and duties to provide emergency medical services by townships
 10 35 and counties. The bill also requires that in order to assist
 11  1 in the transition of emergency medical service providers from
 11  2 townships to counties, all of the real and personal township
 11  3 property used to provide emergency medical service for fiscal
 11  4 years beginning before July 1, 2019, shall be transferred to
 11  5 the county in which the township is located. The county shall
 11  6 also assume all of the outstanding obligations of the township
 11  7 relating to emergency medical service.
 11  8    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 11 11 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

 10  5 authorized by law for use in providing emergency medical
 10  6 services, the board of supervisors may levy an annual tax
 10  7 not exceeding 40.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of the
 10  8 taxable property in the county, excluding property within
 10  9 a benefited emergency medical services district or within
 10 10 the corporate limits of a city, for the purpose of providing
 10 11 emergency medical services under the bill. However, if the
 10 12 county has a population of 300,000 or more, the county may levy
 10 13 an annual tax not exceeding 67.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed
 10 14 value.  However, if such levy is insufficient to provide the
 10 15 emergency medical services required under the bill, the board
 10 16 may levy an additional annual tax not exceeding 20.25 cents
 10 17 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Of all such levies imposed by
 10 18 the county, the board may credit to a reserve account annually
 10 19 an amount not to exceed 30 cents per $1,000 of the assessed
 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the
 10 25 levy under the bill.
 10 26    The bill authorizes the board of supervisors to divide the
 10 27 unincorporated area of the county into tax districts for the
 10 28 purpose of providing emergency medical services and levying
 10 29 a different tax rate in each district, but the tax levied
 10 30 in a tax district shall not exceed the tax levy limitations
 10 31 established in the bill.
 10 32    The bill makes other corresponding changes to other
 10 33 provisions of law as the result of the changes to the authority
 10 34 and duties to provide emergency medical services by townships
 10 35 and counties. The bill also requires that in order to assist
 11  1 in the transition of emergency medical service providers from
 11  2 townships to counties, all of the real and personal township
 11  3 property used to provide emergency medical service for fiscal
 11  4 years beginning before July 1, 2019, shall be transferred to
 11  5 the county in which the township is located. The county shall
 11  6 also assume all of the outstanding obligations of the township
 11  7 relating to emergency medical service.
 11  8    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 11 11 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 12 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

  8 34                           EXPLANATION
  8 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  2    Current Code section 359.42 authorizes but does not require
  9  3 the board of township trustees to provide emergency medical
  9  4 service for the township and to fund such service through
  9  5 imposition of a property tax levy under Code section 359.43.
  9  6 This bill strikes authorization for townships to provide
  9  7 emergency medical services and to levy the property tax for
  9  8 those services beginning July 1, 2019.
  9  9    The bill requires each county to establish an emergency
  9 10 services fund for the deposit of taxes levied for providing
  9 11 emergency medical services under the bill and for the deposit
  9 12 of taxes levied by the county if the county is providing
  9 13 fire protection services under current Code section 331.385.
  9 14 For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019, the
  9 15 county board of supervisors is required to provide emergency
  9 16 medical services to all unincorporated areas of the county
  9 17 except for those areas within a benefited emergency medical
  9 18 services district established under Code chapter 357F.  The
  9 19 board of supervisors is required to create, by ordinance, an
  9 20 emergency medical services commission to assume jurisdiction
  9 21 and management of the provision of emergency medical services
  9 22 under the bill.  An emergency medical services commission shall
  9 23 be composed of the sheriff and four public members appointed
  9 24 by the board. The emergency medical services commission is
  9 25 required to develop, adopt, and submit for approval of the
  9 26 board, a comprehensive emergency medical service plan which
  9 27 meets the requirements of Code chapter 147A and rules adopted
  9 28 by the department of public health for the provision of
  9 29 emergency medical services.
  9 30    Using taxes levied under the bill and other funds of the
  9 31 county authorized by law for use in providing emergency
  9 32 medical services, the county or the emergency medical services
  9 33 commission is authorized under the bill to employ emergency
  9 34 medical care providers and other staff, including the cost
  9 35 of salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs, for the
 10  1 provision of emergency medical services, and to purchase,
 10  2 own, rent, or maintain emergency medical service apparatus or
 10  3 equipment and provide housing for the apparatus and equipment.
 10  4    Under the bill, in addition to other funds of the county
 10  5 authorized by law for use in providing emergency medical
 10  6 services, the board of supervisors may levy an annual tax
 10  7 not exceeding 40.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of the
 10  8 taxable property in the county, excluding property within
 10  9 a benefited emergency medical services district or within
 10 10 the corporate limits of a city, for the purpose of providing
 10 11 emergency medical services under the bill. However, if the
 10 12 county has a population of 300,000 or more, the county may levy
 10 13 an annual tax not exceeding 67.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed
 10 14 value.  However, if such levy is insufficient to provide the
 10 15 emergency medical services required under the bill, the board
 10 16 may levy an additional annual tax not exceeding 20.25 cents
 10 17 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Of all such levies imposed by
 10 18 the county, the board may credit to a reserve account annually
 10 19 an amount not to exceed 30 cents per $1,000 of the assessed
 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the
 10 25 levy under the bill.
 10 26    The bill authorizes the board of supervisors to divide the
 10 27 unincorporated area of the county into tax districts for the
 10 28 purpose of providing emergency medical services and levying
 10 29 a different tax rate in each district, but the tax levied
 10 30 in a tax district shall not exceed the tax levy limitations
 10 31 established in the bill.
 10 32    The bill makes other corresponding changes to other
 10 33 provisions of law as the result of the changes to the authority
 10 34 and duties to provide emergency medical services by townships
 10 35 and counties. The bill also requires that in order to assist
 11  1 in the transition of emergency medical service providers from
 11  2 townships to counties, all of the real and personal township
 11  3 property used to provide emergency medical service for fiscal
 11  4 years beginning before July 1, 2019, shall be transferred to
 11  5 the county in which the township is located. The county shall
 11  6 also assume all of the outstanding obligations of the township
 11  7 relating to emergency medical service.
 11  8    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11  9 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,

  9 15 county board of supervisors is required to provide emergency
  9 16 medical services to all unincorporated areas of the county
  9 17 except for those areas within a benefited emergency medical
  9 18 services district established under Code chapter 357F.  The
  9 19 board of supervisors is required to create, by ordinance, an
  9 20 emergency medical services commission to assume jurisdiction
  9 21 and management of the provision of emergency medical services
  9 22 under the bill.  An emergency medical services commission shall
  9 23 be composed of the sheriff and four public members appointed
  9 24 by the board. The emergency medical services commission is
  9 25 required to develop, adopt, and submit for approval of the
  9 26 board, a comprehensive emergency medical service plan which
  9 27 meets the requirements of Code chapter 147A and rules adopted
  9 28 by the department of public health for the provision of
  9 29 emergency medical services.
  9 30    Using taxes levied under the bill and other funds of the
  9 31 county authorized by law for use in providing emergency
  9 32 medical services, the county or the emergency medical services
  9 33 commission is authorized under the bill to employ emergency
  9 34 medical care providers and other staff, including the cost
  9 35 of salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs, for the
 10  1 provision of emergency medical services, and to purchase,
 10  2 own, rent, or maintain emergency medical service apparatus or
 10  3 equipment and provide housing for the apparatus and equipment.
 10  4    Under the bill, in addition to other funds of the county
 10  5 authorized by law for use in providing emergency medical
 10  6 services, the board of supervisors may levy an annual tax
 10  7 not exceeding 40.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of the
 10  8 taxable property in the county, excluding property within
 10  9 a benefited emergency medical services district or within
 10 10 the corporate limits of a city, for the purpose of providing
 10 11 emergency medical services under the bill. However, if the
 10 12 county has a population of 300,000 or more, the county may levy
 10 13 an annual tax not exceeding 67.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed
 10 14 value.  However, if such levy is insufficient to provide the
 10 15 emergency medical services required under the bill, the board
 10 16 may levy an additional annual tax not exceeding 20.25 cents
 10 17 per $1,000 of assessed value.  Of all such levies imposed by
 10 18 the county, the board may credit to a reserve account annually
 10 19 an amount not to exceed 30 cents per $1,000 of the assessed
 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the
 10 25 levy under the bill.
 10 26    The bill authorizes the board of supervisors to divide the
 10 27 unincorporated area of the county into tax districts for the
 10 28 purpose of providing emergency medical services and levying
 10 29 a different tax rate in each district, but the tax levied
 10 30 in a tax district shall not exceed the tax levy limitations
 10 31 established in the bill.
 10 32    The bill makes other corresponding changes to other
 10 33 provisions of law as the result of the changes to the authority
 10 34 and duties to provide emergency medical services by townships
 10 35 and counties. The bill also requires that in order to assist
 11  1 in the transition of emergency medical service providers from
 11  2 townships to counties, all of the real and personal township
 11  3 property used to provide emergency medical service for fiscal
 11  4 years beginning before July 1, 2019, shall be transferred to
 11  5 the county in which the township is located. The county shall
 11  6 also assume all of the outstanding obligations of the township
 11  7 relating to emergency medical service.
 11  8    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11  9 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 10 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 11 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 12 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 13 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 11 14 mandate included in the bill.
 11 15    Except for the section of the bill enacting transition
 11 16 provisions, the bill takes effect July 1, 2019. The bill
 11 17 applies to property taxes due and payable in fiscal years

  9 29 emergency medical services.
  9 30    Using taxes levied under the bill and other funds of the

  9 32 medical services, the county or the emergency medical services
  9 33 commission is authorized under the bill to employ emergency

  9 35 of salaries, benefits, and other personnel costs, for the
 10  1 provision of emergency medical services, and to purchase,

 10 20 value for the purchase or replacement of supplies and equipment
 10 21 required to provide emergency medical services under the bill.
 10 22 The bill authorizes counties to anticipate the collection of
 10 23 taxes authorized in the bill and for such purposes may issue
 10 24 bonds payable only from tax levies on property subject to the
 10 25 levy under the bill.
