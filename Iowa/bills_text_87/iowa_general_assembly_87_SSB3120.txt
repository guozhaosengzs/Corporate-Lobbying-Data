The

shall
adopt
a
policy
that

following
statements:
4


1.
That
the
primary
function

the
discovery,

dissemination
of
knowledge
by
means

research,
teaching,
7


discussion,
and
debate.
This

the

must
strive
to
ensure
9


the
fullest
degree
of
intellectual
freedom
and
free

That
students
and
faculty
have
the
freedom
to
discuss

any

alternative
means
of
expression.
