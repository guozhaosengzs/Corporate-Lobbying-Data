  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 11  4 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 11  5 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 11  6 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 11  7 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; and
 11  8 (4) class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years
 11  9 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three

  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who

  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished

  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the

  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment

  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter

  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 11  4 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 11  5 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 11  6 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 11  7 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; and
 11  8 (4) class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years
 11  9 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.

  8 19                           EXPLANATION
  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 11  4 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 11  5 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 11  6 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 11  7 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; and
 11  8 (4) class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years
 11  9 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

  8 19                           EXPLANATION
  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 11  4 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 11  5 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 11  6 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 11  7 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; and
 11  8 (4) class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years
 11  9 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).

  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).

  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of

  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended

  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 11  4 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 11  5 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 11  6 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 11  7 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; and

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or

 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be

 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.

  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse

  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of

  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the

 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is

 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was

 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with

  8 19                           EXPLANATION
  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 11  4 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 11  5 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 11  6 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 11  7 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; and
 11  8 (4) class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years
 11  9 and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.

  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse

  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the

 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).

 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 11  4 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 11  5 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 11  6 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two

  8 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 22    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
  8 23 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
  8 24 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
  8 25 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with

 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.

 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.

 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 11  2 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 11  3 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

  8 26 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
  8 27 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture

 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until

  8 28 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
  8 29 481A.42).
  8 30    NAMED OFFENSES.  The bill amends three different criminal
  8 31 offenses in Code chapter 717B, animal abuse (Code section
  8 32 717B.2), animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal
  8 33 torture (Code section 717B.3A).  Under the bill, each of
  8 34 the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
  8 35 convicted person who has previously committed any of the three
  9  1 offenses. The enhanced penalty also applies if the convicted
  9  2 person previously committed three other named offenses: injury
  9  3 to or interference with a police service dog (Code section
  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until

  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
 11  1 APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are

  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised

  9  4 717B.9); bestiality (Code section 717C.1); or an act involving
  9  5 an animal contest (Code section 717D.2).
  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).

 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was

 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with

  9  6    THREATENED ANIMALS == RESCUE.  Currently, a local law
  9  7 enforcement officer and local authority may rescue an animal
  9  8 if there is cause to believe that an animal is threatened with
  9  9 abuse, neglect, or torture as these offenses have been amended
  9 10 (Code sections 717B.2 and 717B.5). The bill has revised
  9 11 the elements or exceptions for each of those offenses (Code
  9 12 sections 717B.2, 717B.3, and 717B.3A).
  9 13    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Currently, animal abuse
  9 14 involves intentionally injuring an animal by violence or
  9 15 poisoning.  The bill replaces the intent element with that of
  9 16 acting knowingly or recklessly.  It also removes a provision
  9 17 that exempted a person who acted with the consent of the
  9 18 animal's owner. A new exception applies to a person who
  9 19 euthanizes an animal due to age or condition. The bill reduces
  9 20 the penalty from an aggravated to a serious misdemeanor for
  9 21 committing animal abuse that causes injury and retains the
  9 22 penalty of aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse
  9 23 that causes death. The bill provides that the aggravated
  9 24 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
  9 25 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.
  9 35 The bill requires that a person must knowingly or recklessly
 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal
 10  3 penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the penalty is
 10  4 increased to a serious misdemeanor if the offense causes injury
 10  5 and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the neglect causes death.
 10  6 In a case where the animal is injured or dies, the aggravated
 10  7 misdemeanor is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10  8 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 10  9    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== TORTURE.  Currently, animal torture
 10 10 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 10 11 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 10 12 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 10 13 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment
 10 23 which is addressed in another part of the bill.
 10 24    COURT ORDERS.  The bill provides at the time of conviction
 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or
 10 27 psychiatric evaluation and treatment.  A person convicted of
 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).

  9 26    CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== NEGLECT.  Currently, animal neglect
  9 27 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
  9 28 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
  9 29 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
  9 30 with a number of items including adequate supplies of
  9 31 nutritional food, access to potable water, adequate sanitary
  9 32 conditions,  ventilated shelter sufficient to provide the
  9 33 animal with protection from extreme weather conditions, and,
  9 34 subject to certain exceptions, necessary veterinary care.

 10  1 fail to provide an animal with any of these items. The bill
 10  2 eliminates the torture element.  The bill retains the criminal

 10 14 results in prolonged or repeated suffering and injury or death.
 10 15 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 10 16 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for the
 10 17 first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent offense.
 10 18 Instead, a person is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor,
 10 19 which is enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person was
 10 20 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 10 21 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 10 22 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment

 10 25 for committing animal abuse or animal torture, that a person
 10 26 may be subject to a court order requiring a psychological or

 10 28 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture may also be
 10 29 subject to a court order prohibiting the person from owning,
 10 30 possessing, or living with an animal. A person who violates a
 10 31 court order is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
 10 32    STATE MANDATE.  Currently, if a threatened animal is rescued
 10 33 by a local law enforcement officer and local authority, the
 10 34 local authority must provide for the animal's maintenance until
 10 35 the matter's disposition (Code sections 717B.5 and 717B.4).
