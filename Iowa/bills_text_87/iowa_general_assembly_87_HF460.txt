  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines

  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than

  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting

  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information

  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual

  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as

  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before

  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual

  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual

  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each

  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if

  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to

  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and

  6  3 noncollecting retailer.

  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be

  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not

  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as

  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements

  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual

  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting

  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer

  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting

  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before

  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for

  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,

  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit

  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that

  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross

  6  3 noncollecting retailer.

  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the

  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that

  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and

  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting

  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information

  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if

  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for

  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely

  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The

  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification

  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information

  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.

  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose

  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting

  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the

  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information

  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if

  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose

  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting

  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements

  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,

  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not

  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting

  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a

  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if

  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the

  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit

  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and

  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not

  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as

  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,

  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5  4 statement requirement before being issued a demand from the
  5  5 department, and provides the required annual statements within
  5  6 sixty days of being issued such demand, the total penalty
  5  7 imposed under this paragraph for the year in which the demand

  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely

  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual

  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such
  8 17 subpoenas.

  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit

  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and

  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not

  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the

  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if

  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as
  6  7 described in the bill and as prescribed by the department of
  6  8 revenue (department) by rule regarding the obligations to pay
  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.
  7 15    ANNUAL STATEMENT.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  7 16 retailer to provide by March 31 of each year an annual
  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who
  7 20 are not required to provide any annual notifications are
  7 21 exempt from filing an annual statement with the department.
  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,
  7 29 but imposes fine limits under certain circumstances.  First, if
  7 30 for any calendar year the annual statement is filed within 30
  7 31 days of the due date, the total annual statement penalties for
  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,
  7 35 and provides the required annual statements within 60 days of
  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.
  8  5    The bill provides that the sale notification, annual
  8  6 notification, or annual statement penalties shall not apply to
  8  7 a noncollecting retailer for any calendar year in which all of
  8  8 the noncollecting retailer's Iowa sales to Iowa purchasers are
  8  9 exempt from the Iowa sales or use tax.  Also, the bill allows
  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the
  8 13 department shall have the power to subpoena from noncollecting
  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to
  8 16 any district court or judicial magistrate to enforce such

  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and

  6  3 noncollecting retailer.

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the

  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
  7 14 burden of proving it did not have actual knowledge.

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to

  7 17 statement to the department showing the Iowa sales made to each
  7 18 Iowa purchaser for the previous year, and any other information
  7 19 prescribed by the department.  Noncollecting retailers who

  7 22 The department may require noncollecting retailers with over
  7 23 $100,000 in total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year to
  7 24 file the annual statement in an electronic format.
  7 25    The bill imposes a penalty for failure to timely file an
  7 26 annual statement that is equal to the product of $10 multiplied
  7 27 by the number of Iowa purchasers for which the retailer failed
  7 28 to provide the required information in the annual statement,

  7 32 that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Second, if a noncollecting
  7 33 retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual statement
  7 34 requirement before being issued a demand from the department,

  8  1 the demand, the total annual statement penalties for that year,
  8  2 and for each previous year, shall not exceed $10,000 per year.
  8  3 The noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did
  8  4 not have actual knowledge.

  8 10 the department to waive all or a portion of any penalty upon a
  8 11 showing of reasonable cause by the noncollecting retailer.
  8 12    Finally, the bill provides that the director of the

  8 14 retailers any records and documents necessary to administer
  8 15 the reporting requirements, and may make application to

  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill concerns retailers who do not collect and remit
  5 26 Iowa sales and use tax (noncollecting retailer).  The bill
  5 27 creates three reporting requirements for noncollecting
  5 28 retailers who make sales of tangible personal property that
  5 29 are delivered to purchasers within Iowa.  The bill defines
  5 30 several terms, including "Iowa purchaser" and "Iowa sale".  The
  5 31 bill exempts from the reporting requirements any noncollecting
  5 32 retailer whose Iowa sales during a calendar year are all
  5 33 delivered digitally, and any noncollecting retailer whose
  5 34 total gross Iowa sales during a calendar year are less than
  5 35 $100,000.  For purposes of this $100,000 threshold, total gross
  6  1 Iowa sales includes the sales of the noncollecting retailer and
  6  2 of any entity controlled by or under common control with the
  6  3 noncollecting retailer.
  6  4    SALE NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6  5 retailer to provide Iowa purchasers with a notification for
  6  6 each sale (sale notification) that contains information as

  6  9 applicable Iowa sales and use tax and file Iowa sales and use
  6 10 tax returns.  The bill requires each sale notification to be
  6 11 made in the manner, form, and time period prescribed by the
  6 12 department.
  6 13    The bill imposes a penalty of $5 for each failure to timely
  6 14 provide a sale notification, but also imposes fine limits
  6 15 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of sale
  6 16 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  6 17 retailer is required to provide sale notifications shall not
  6 18 exceed $50,000.  Second, if a noncollecting retailer has no
  6 19 actual knowledge of the sale notification requirement before
  6 20 being issued a demand from the department, and begins providing
  6 21 the required sale notifications within 60 days of the demand,
  6 22 the total sale notification penalties for that year, and for
  6 23 each previous year, shall not exceed $5,000 per year.   The
  6 24 noncollecting retailer bears the burden of proving it did not
  6 25 have actual knowledge.
  6 26    ANNUAL NOTIFICATION.  The bill requires a noncollecting
  6 27 retailer to provide an annual notification to Iowa purchasers
  6 28 who make Iowa purchases of $500 or more from the noncollecting
  6 29 retailer during the year.  The annual notification must be made
  6 30 by January 31 of each year summarizing the sales made to the
  6 31 Iowa purchaser for the previous year.  The annual notification
  6 32 must also contain other information and meet other requirements
  6 33 as described in the bill and as prescribed by the department.
  6 34    The bill imposes a penalty of $10 for each failure to timely
  6 35 provide an annual notification, but also imposes fine limits
  7  1 under certain circumstances.  First, the total amount of annual
  7  2 notification penalties for the first year the noncollecting
  7  3 retailer is required to provide annual notifications shall
  7  4 not exceed $50,000.  Second, if for any calendar year a
  7  5 noncollecting retailer provides all the annual notifications
  7  6 within 30 days of the due date, the total annual notification
  7  7 penalties for that year shall not exceed $1,000.  Third, if a
  7  8 noncollecting retailer has no actual knowledge of the annual
  7  9 notification requirement before being issued a demand from the
  7 10 department, and provides the required annual notifications
  7 11 within 60 days of the demand, the total annual notification
  7 12 penalties for that year, and for each previous year, shall not
  7 13 exceed $10,000 per year.  The noncollecting retailer bears the
