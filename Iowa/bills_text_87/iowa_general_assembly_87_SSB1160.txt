The

Telehealth

in
an
emergency
where
the
life
or
18


health
of

or
if
19


the

generic
nature,
not
specific
to
the
individual
patient.

The
provision
is
not

from
imposing
deductibles
or
23


copayment
or
coinsurance
requirements
for
a
health

if
the
deductible,
copayment,
or

coinsurance
does
not
exceed
the
deductible,
copayment,
or
26


coinsurance
applicable
to
an
in-person
consultation
for
the
27


same
health

service.
The
bill
provides
that
a
third-party
28


payment
provider
shall
not
impose
annual
