 51  9 motorized bicycle, or truck tractor, and are required to be
 51 10 attached to the front and rear of the vehicle.

 51 13 be attached to the rear of the motor vehicle, except that the
 51 14 registration plate for a truck tractor shall be attached to the
 51 15 front of the truck tractor, in accord with current law.
 51 16    The bill also makes corresponding Code language changes,
 51 17 makes some Code language changes to enhance readability,
 51 18 updates certain references to the United States Code, directs
 51 19 the Code editor to make changes to language referring to two
 51 20 registration plates rather than one, and provides for the
