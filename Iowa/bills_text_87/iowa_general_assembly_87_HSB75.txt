This
bill
establishes
a
motor
vehicle
insurance
verification
7


program
to
be
administered
by
the
department
of
transportation
8


(DOT).
The
DOT
is
required
to
contract
with
a
third
party
9


for
four
years
to
act
as
the
DOT’s
designated
agent
for
10


administration
of
the
program.
11


The
bill
requires
the
DOT
to
establish
an
advisory
council
12


to
make
recommendations
to
the
DOT
on
the
best
methods
and
13


practices
for
implementing
a
real-time
internet
services
model
14


for
insurance
verification,
to
assist
in
the
development
of
15


a
guide
for
insurers
detailing
the
data
fields
and
other
16


information
necessary
for
compliance
with
the
bill,
and
to
17


provide
an
annual
report
to
the
DOT
detailing
the
improvements
18


and
implementation
efforts
relating
to
insurance
verification
19


in
other
states
for
consideration
in
improving
compliance
and
20


operations
in
this
state.
21


The
designated
agent
is
required
to
establish
and
maintain
a
22


database
containing
information
from
insurers
relating
to
motor
23


vehicle
insurance
coverage
for
registered
motor
vehicles,
motor
24


vehicle
identification
information,
personal
identification
25


information
for
registered
owners
of
motor
vehicles,
and
any
26


other
information
provided
to
the
designated
agent
by
the
DOT.
27


At
least
twice
per
month,
the
designated
agent
must
update
the
28


database
and
compare
current
motor
vehicle
registrations
with
29


updated
insurance
information.
If
records
in

database
30


indicate
that
a
registered
motor
vehicle
is
not
covered
under
31


an
owner’s
policy
of
liability
insurance,
the
bill
requires
the
32


designated
agent
to
use
a
real-time
internet
services
model
33


to
determine
if
the
registered
motor
vehicle
is
covered
under
34


an
owner’s
policy
of

insurance.

If

records
and
the
real-time
internet
services
3


model
show
that
a
registered
motor
vehicle
is
not
covered
under
4


an
owner’s
policy
of
liability
insurance
for
three
consecutive
5


months,
the
designated
agent
is
required
to
send
a
notice
to
6


the
owner
requiring
the
owner
to
respond
within
15
days
by
7


providing
proof
of
financial
liability
coverage
or
proof
that
8


the
owner
is
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
maintain
financial
9


liability
coverage.
If
the
owner
fails
to
respond,
a
second
10


notice
must
be
sent.
If
the
owner
does
not
respond
to
the
11


second
notice,
the
owner’s
motor
vehicle
registration
must
12


be
revoked
by
the
DOT
and
the
owner
is
required
to
surrender
13


the
registration
plates
and
registration
receipt
for
the
14


vehicle
to
the
county
treasurer.
In
order
to
obtain
a
new
15


registration
for
the
vehicle,
the
owner
must
comply
with
16


financial
responsibility
requirements
and
pay
an
administrative
17


fee
of
$100.
The
fees
collected
are
to
be
used
by
the
DOT
18


exclusively
to
offset
the
costs
of
administering
the
program,
19


including
payments
made
to
the
designated
agent.
20


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
motor
vehicle
is
covered
by
a
21


form
of
financial
liability
coverage
other
than
an
insurance
22


policy,
or
if
a
real-time
internet
services
model
indicates
a
23


vehicle
is
appropriately
insured,
that
fact
shall
be
noted
in
24


the
database.
25


The
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
providing
false
or
26


fraudulent

to
the
DOT
or
the
DOT’s
designated
27


agent
in
relation
to
the
motor
vehicle
insurance
verification
28


program.
A
violation
of
this
provision
is
a
simple
29


misdemeanor.


30


The
bill
requires
each
insurer
that
issues
a
policy
to
the
31


owner
of
a
motor
vehicle
that
includes
motor
vehicle
