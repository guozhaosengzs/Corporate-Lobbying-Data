  5 32 criminal penalties for cocaine base, making inapplicable
  5 33 certain provisions relating to mandatory sentences, mandatory
  5 34 minimum sentences, limitations on parole and work release, and

  6  1 COCAINE BASE.  The bill increases the amounts of controlled
  6  2 substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine) that
  6  3 determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.  Under
  6  4 the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
  6  5 or possesses with the intent to manufacture or deliver a
  6  6 controlled substance containing cocaine base, or unlawfully
  6  7 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
  6  8 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
  6  9 or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver such
  6 10 a controlled substance, the person commits the following
  6 11 offenses: a class "B" felony punishable by confinement of no
  6 12 more than 50 years and a fine of not more than $1 million if the
  6 13 controlled substance containing cocaine base is more than 250
  6 14 grams rather than the current more than 50 grams; a class "B"
  6 15 felony punishable by confinement of no more than 25 years and a

  6 19 than 50 grams; or a class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not

  6 23    CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSE SENTENCES THAT COMMENCED PRIOR TO JULY
  6 24 1, 2017. Effective July 1, 2017, the bill provides that a
  6 25 person whose sentence commenced prior to July 1, 2017, for a

  6 27 small quantity, drug manufacturing, delivery, or possession
  6 28 with intent to manufacture or deliver offenses), who has not
  6 29 been previously convicted of a forcible felony, and who does
  6 30 not have a prior conviction under Code section 124.401(1)(a),
  6 31 (b), or (c), shall not be required to serve a minimum term of

  7  6    STANDARD SENTENCE.  As used in the bill, "standard sentence"
  7  7 means a sentencing option whereby the court at sentencing
  7  8 allows a person to be sentenced within the parameters
  7  9 of the misdemeanor or felony offense classification and
  7 10 makes inapplicable other provisions, or any combination
  7 11 of such provisions, that would otherwise have the effect
  7 12 of mandating a term of confinement, lengthening the term
  7 13 of confinement, limiting the accumulation of earned time
  7 14 pursuant to Code section 903A.2, subsection 1, paragraph "b",
  7 15 limiting eligibility for parole or work release, or imposing
  7 16 an additional sentence commencing upon completion of the
  7 17 underlying sentence pursuant to Code chapter 903B.
  7 18    The court may impose a standard sentence pursuant to the
  7 19 bill if the court finds all of the following: a compelling
  7 20 reason that imposing a sentence other than a standard sentence
  7 21 would result in a substantial injustice to the defendant, and a
  7 22 sentence other than a standard sentence is not necessary for
  7 23 the protection of the public.
  7 24    If a person is sentenced to a term of confinement under
  7 25 a standard sentence classified as a felony, the person shall
  7 26 be sentenced as provided in Code section 902.9 applicable for
  7 27 that felony classification, and if the person is sentenced to a
  7 28 term of confinement under a standard sentence classified as a
  7 29 misdemeanor, the person shall be sentenced as provided in Code
  7 30 section 903.1, and confined as provided in Code section 903.4.
  7 31    The bill lists numerous criminal offenses that are not
  7 32 eligible for the imposition of a standard sentence.
  7 33    The bill provides that if a person commits an offense that
  7 34 requires the person to register as a sex offender, a standard
  7 35 sentence shall not change the requirement to register or change
  8  1 the duration of registration. However, if the person is no
  8  2 longer required to serve a special sentence under Code chapter
  8  3 903B due to the imposition of a standard sentence, the duration
  8  4 of registration shall not be less than the period specified in
  8  5 Code section 692A.106(1) which is 10 years.

  8 12 after the person has served one=half of the minimum term of
  8 13 confinement prescribed in Code section 902.12.
  8 14    ROBBERY IN THE FIRST DEGREE.  The bill provides that an

  8 17 1, 2017, shall serve between 50 and 70 percent of a 25=year
  8 18 class "B" felony sentence. In determining when the person
  8 19 first becomes eligible for parole or work release within the
  8 20 parameters of 50 and 70 percent of the 25=year sentence,
  8 21 the sentencing court shall base its determination upon all
  8 22 pertinent information including the person's criminal record, a
  8 23 validated risk assessment, and the negative impact the offense
  8 24 has had on the victim or other persons.
