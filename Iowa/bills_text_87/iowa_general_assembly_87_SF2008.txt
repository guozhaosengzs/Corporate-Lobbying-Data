  1  3    1.  a.  The department shall not approve an application
  1  4 for a permit for the construction, including expansion, of a
  1  5 confinement feeding operation structure under this chapter, if
  1  6 the structure is part of a confinement feeding operation in
  1  7 which swine are kept.
  1  8    b.  A person shall not begin construction, including
  1  9 expansion, of a confinement feeding operation structure under
  1 10 this chapter, if the structure is part of a confinement feeding
  1 11 operation in which swine are kept. However, this paragraph
  1 12 does not apply to a confinement feeding operation which has an
  1 13 animal unit capacity of three hundred or fewer animal units.
  1 14    2.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a person from
  1 15 completing construction, including expansion, of a confinement
  1 16 feeding operation structure, if prior to the effective date
  1 17 of this Act, the person has begun construction, including
  1 18 expansion, of the confinement feeding operation structure as

  1 22 is requested to establish an interim study committee to
  1 23 consider methods to provide for greater public participation
  1 24 in the process of approving or disapproving the construction,
  1 25 including expansion, of confinement feeding operation
  1 26 structures which are part of confinement feeding operations
  1 27 where swine are kept.  The interim study committee shall
  1 28 consider methods to provide for greater decision=making by
  1 29 county boards of supervisors and by the reformation of the
  1 30 master matrix as  provided in section 459.305.  If established,
  1 31 the interim study committee shall submit a report to the
  1 32 general assembly by January 11, 2019, which includes findings
  1 33 and recommendations.

  2  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  4    MORATORIUM.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the animal
  2  5 agriculture compliance Act) by establishing a moratorium upon
  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures such as buildings or manure
  2  8 storage structures associated with the confinement feeding
  2  9 operation where swine are kept. The moratorium does not apply
  2 10 to a confinement feeding operation having an animal unit
  2 11 capacity of 300 or fewer animal units.
  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
  2 14 approving an application for a construction permit, and that
  2 15 a person is prohibited from beginning such construction.  The
  2 16 bill does not prohibit a person from completing construction
  2 17 if, prior to the  effective date of the bill, the person has
  2 18 begun the construction.
  2 19    LEGISLATIVE STUDY.  The bill requests that the legislative
  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase a greater public participation in the construction
  2 22 of confinement feeding operation structures associated with
  2 23 swine production and submit a report to the general assembly by
  2 24 January 11, 2019.
  2 25    BACKGROUND.  A confinement feeding operation refers to any
  2 26 area in which certain animals associated with agriculture
  2 27 are confined and fed and maintained under a roof for 45
  2 28 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  2 29 structures including building and facilities used to store
  2 30 manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure is
  2 31 required for a confinement feeding operation of a certain size
  2 32 based on a calculation of its proposed animal unit capacity
  2 33 (AUC) which equals the maximum number of animal units that
  2 34 may be maintained under roof at any one time (Code section
  2 35 459.102). Each of various types of animals are assigned a
  3  1 special equivalency factor. For example, a butcher or breeding
  3  2 swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an equivalency factor
  3  3 of 0.4 animal units (Code section 459.102). For example, a
  3  4 confinement feeding operation proposed to include one or more
  3  5 buildings with a capacity of 1,400 breeding swine would be
  3  6 required to obtain a permit (1,400 x 0.4 = 560 AUC).  A proposed
  3  7 confinement feeding operation having a capacity of 750 such
  3  8 swine would be exempt from the moratorium (750 x 0.4 = 300
  3  9 AUC).
  3 10    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  3 11 that date.

  2  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  4    MORATORIUM.  This bill amends Code chapter 459 (the animal
  2  5 agriculture compliance Act) by establishing a moratorium upon
  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures such as buildings or manure
  2  8 storage structures associated with the confinement feeding
  2  9 operation where swine are kept. The moratorium does not apply
  2 10 to a confinement feeding operation having an animal unit
  2 11 capacity of 300 or fewer animal units.
  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from
  2 14 approving an application for a construction permit, and that
  2 15 a person is prohibited from beginning such construction.  The
  2 16 bill does not prohibit a person from completing construction
  2 17 if, prior to the  effective date of the bill, the person has
  2 18 begun the construction.
  2 19    LEGISLATIVE STUDY.  The bill requests that the legislative
  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase a greater public participation in the construction
  2 22 of confinement feeding operation structures associated with
  2 23 swine production and submit a report to the general assembly by
  2 24 January 11, 2019.
  2 25    BACKGROUND.  A confinement feeding operation refers to any
  2 26 area in which certain animals associated with agriculture
  2 27 are confined and fed and maintained under a roof for 45
  2 28 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  2 29 structures including building and facilities used to store
  2 30 manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure is
  2 31 required for a confinement feeding operation of a certain size
  2 32 based on a calculation of its proposed animal unit capacity
  2 33 (AUC) which equals the maximum number of animal units that
  2 34 may be maintained under roof at any one time (Code section
  2 35 459.102). Each of various types of animals are assigned a
  3  1 special equivalency factor. For example, a butcher or breeding
  3  2 swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an equivalency factor
  3  3 of 0.4 animal units (Code section 459.102). For example, a
  3  4 confinement feeding operation proposed to include one or more
  3  5 buildings with a capacity of 1,400 breeding swine would be
  3  6 required to obtain a permit (1,400 x 0.4 = 560 AUC).  A proposed
  3  7 confinement feeding operation having a capacity of 750 such
  3  8 swine would be exempt from the moratorium (750 x 0.4 = 300
  3  9 AUC).

  2  6 the construction, including expansion, of certain confinement
  2  7 feeding operation structures such as buildings or manure

  2 24 January 11, 2019.
  2 25    BACKGROUND.  A confinement feeding operation refers to any
  2 26 area in which certain animals associated with agriculture
  2 27 are confined and fed and maintained under a roof for 45
  2 28 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  2 29 structures including building and facilities used to store
  2 30 manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure is
  2 31 required for a confinement feeding operation of a certain size
  2 32 based on a calculation of its proposed animal unit capacity
  2 33 (AUC) which equals the maximum number of animal units that
  2 34 may be maintained under roof at any one time (Code section
  2 35 459.102). Each of various types of animals are assigned a

  2 12    The bill provides that during the period of the moratorium,
  2 13 the department of natural resources is prohibited from

  2 20 council establish an interim committee to study methods to
  2 21 increase a greater public participation in the construction
  2 22 of confinement feeding operation structures associated with
  2 23 swine production and submit a report to the general assembly by
  2 24 January 11, 2019.
  2 25    BACKGROUND.  A confinement feeding operation refers to any
  2 26 area in which certain animals associated with agriculture
  2 27 are confined and fed and maintained under a roof for 45
  2 28 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  2 29 structures including building and facilities used to store
  2 30 manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure is
  2 31 required for a confinement feeding operation of a certain size
  2 32 based on a calculation of its proposed animal unit capacity
  2 33 (AUC) which equals the maximum number of animal units that
  2 34 may be maintained under roof at any one time (Code section
  2 35 459.102). Each of various types of animals are assigned a
  3  1 special equivalency factor. For example, a butcher or breeding
  3  2 swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an equivalency factor
  3  3 of 0.4 animal units (Code section 459.102). For example, a
  3  4 confinement feeding operation proposed to include one or more
  3  5 buildings with a capacity of 1,400 breeding swine would be
  3  6 required to obtain a permit (1,400 x 0.4 = 560 AUC).  A proposed
  3  7 confinement feeding operation having a capacity of 750 such
  3  8 swine would be exempt from the moratorium (750 x 0.4 = 300
  3  9 AUC).

  2 25    BACKGROUND.  A confinement feeding operation refers to any
  2 26 area in which certain animals associated with agriculture
  2 27 are confined and fed and maintained under a roof for 45
  2 28 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  2 29 structures including building and facilities used to store
  2 30 manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure is
  2 31 required for a confinement feeding operation of a certain size
  2 32 based on a calculation of its proposed animal unit capacity
  2 33 (AUC) which equals the maximum number of animal units that
  2 34 may be maintained under roof at any one time (Code section
  2 35 459.102). Each of various types of animals are assigned a
  3  1 special equivalency factor. For example, a butcher or breeding
  3  2 swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an equivalency factor
  3  3 of 0.4 animal units (Code section 459.102). For example, a
  3  4 confinement feeding operation proposed to include one or more
  3  5 buildings with a capacity of 1,400 breeding swine would be
  3  6 required to obtain a permit (1,400 x 0.4 = 560 AUC).  A proposed
  3  7 confinement feeding operation having a capacity of 750 such
  3  8 swine would be exempt from the moratorium (750 x 0.4 = 300
  3  9 AUC).

  2 25    BACKGROUND.  A confinement feeding operation refers to any
  2 26 area in which certain animals associated with agriculture
  2 27 are confined and fed and maintained under a roof for 45
  2 28 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  2 29 structures including building and facilities used to store
  2 30 manure. A permit to construct or expand a structure is
  2 31 required for a confinement feeding operation of a certain size
  2 32 based on a calculation of its proposed animal unit capacity
  2 33 (AUC) which equals the maximum number of animal units that
  2 34 may be maintained under roof at any one time (Code section
  2 35 459.102). Each of various types of animals are assigned a
  3  1 special equivalency factor. For example, a butcher or breeding
  3  2 swine weighing more than 55 pounds has an equivalency factor
  3  3 of 0.4 animal units (Code section 459.102). For example, a
  3  4 confinement feeding operation proposed to include one or more
