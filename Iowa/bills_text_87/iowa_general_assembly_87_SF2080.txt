  8  3    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect July 1,

  8  5    Sec. 13.  APPLICABILITY.  The following provisions of this
  8  6 Act are first applicable to calculate the state general fund
  8  7 expenditure limitation for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
  8  8 2019:
  8  9    1.  The sections amending section 8.54.
  8 10    2.  The sections amending section 8.55.
  8 11                           EXPLANATION
  8 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 14    This bill relates to the state general fund expenditure
  8 15 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 16 limitation, creating a safety net fund, creating an Iowa
  8 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, making transfers,
  8 18 and providing for related state personal income tax rate
  8 19 reductions.
  8 20    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 21 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 22 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law,
  8 23 the limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate
  8 24 for the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved
  8 25 by the revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by
  8 26 December 15. The new calculation method in the bill is based
  8 27 on the growth in the average wage and salary component of the
  8 28 quarterly state personal income table for Iowa issued by the
  8 29 bureau of economic analysis of the United States department of
  8 30 commerce.  Under the new method, the department of management
  8 31 and the legislative services agency are directed to apply the
  8 32 component issued for the quarters of a two=year period to
  8 33 jointly calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.
  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,
  8 35 is applied to the amount of the state general fund expenditure
  9  1 limitation for the prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).
  9  2 The lesser amount identified by the two methods is required to
  9  3 be used as the state general fund expenditure limitation in the
  9  4 budget process for the following fiscal year.
  9  5    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  6 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9  7 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9  8 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9  9 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 10 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 11 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 14 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 15 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 16 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 17 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 18 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 19 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 20 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 21 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the
  9 24 fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or transfers
  9 25 made by the general assembly for tax relief and for temporary
  9 26 cash flow purposes.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 28 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 29 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 30 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
  9 31 education, employment, health, human services, and other
  9 32 programs to aid individuals and families with low income.
  9 33    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
  9 34 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
  9 35 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  1 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  2 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  3 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10  4    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10  5 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10  6 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10  7 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10  8 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10  9    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 10 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 11 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 12 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 13 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 14 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 15 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 16 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 17 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 18 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 19 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 20 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 21 January 1, 2020, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 22 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 23    The bill takes effect July 1, 2019. However, the provisions
 10 24 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 25 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the
 10 26 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019 (FY 2019=2020).

  8 15 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 16 limitation, creating a safety net fund, creating an Iowa
  8 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, making transfers,
  8 18 and providing for related state personal income tax rate
  8 19 reductions.
  8 20    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 21 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 22 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law,
  8 23 the limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate
  8 24 for the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved
  8 25 by the revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by
  8 26 December 15. The new calculation method in the bill is based
  8 27 on the growth in the average wage and salary component of the
  8 28 quarterly state personal income table for Iowa issued by the
  8 29 bureau of economic analysis of the United States department of
  8 30 commerce.  Under the new method, the department of management
  8 31 and the legislative services agency are directed to apply the
  8 32 component issued for the quarters of a two=year period to
  8 33 jointly calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.
  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,
  8 35 is applied to the amount of the state general fund expenditure
  9  1 limitation for the prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).
  9  2 The lesser amount identified by the two methods is required to
  9  3 be used as the state general fund expenditure limitation in the
  9  4 budget process for the following fiscal year.
  9  5    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  6 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9  7 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9  8 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9  9 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 10 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 11 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 14 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 15 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 16 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 17 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 18 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 19 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 20 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 21 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the
  9 24 fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or transfers
  9 25 made by the general assembly for tax relief and for temporary
  9 26 cash flow purposes.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 28 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 29 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 30 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
  9 31 education, employment, health, human services, and other
  9 32 programs to aid individuals and families with low income.
  9 33    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
  9 34 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
  9 35 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  1 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  2 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  3 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10  4    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10  5 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10  6 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10  7 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10  8 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10  9    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 10 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 11 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 12 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 13 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 14 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 15 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 16 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 17 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 18 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 19 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 20 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 21 January 1, 2020, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 22 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 23    The bill takes effect July 1, 2019. However, the provisions
 10 24 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 25 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the

  8 14    This bill relates to the state general fund expenditure
  8 15 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 16 limitation, creating a safety net fund, creating an Iowa
  8 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, making transfers,
  8 18 and providing for related state personal income tax rate
  8 19 reductions.
  8 20    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 21 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 22 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law,
  8 23 the limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate
  8 24 for the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved
  8 25 by the revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by
  8 26 December 15. The new calculation method in the bill is based
  8 27 on the growth in the average wage and salary component of the
  8 28 quarterly state personal income table for Iowa issued by the
  8 29 bureau of economic analysis of the United States department of
  8 30 commerce.  Under the new method, the department of management
  8 31 and the legislative services agency are directed to apply the
  8 32 component issued for the quarters of a two=year period to
  8 33 jointly calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.
  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,
  8 35 is applied to the amount of the state general fund expenditure
  9  1 limitation for the prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).
  9  2 The lesser amount identified by the two methods is required to
  9  3 be used as the state general fund expenditure limitation in the
  9  4 budget process for the following fiscal year.
  9  5    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  6 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9  7 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9  8 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9  9 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 10 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 11 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 14 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 15 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 16 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 17 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 18 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 19 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 20 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 21 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the
  9 24 fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or transfers
  9 25 made by the general assembly for tax relief and for temporary
  9 26 cash flow purposes.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 28 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 29 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 30 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
  9 31 education, employment, health, human services, and other
  9 32 programs to aid individuals and families with low income.
  9 33    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
  9 34 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
  9 35 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  1 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  2 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  3 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10  4    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10  5 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10  6 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10  7 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10  8 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10  9    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 10 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 11 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 12 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 13 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 14 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 15 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 16 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 17 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 18 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 19 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 20 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 21 January 1, 2020, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 22 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 23    The bill takes effect July 1, 2019. However, the provisions
 10 24 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 25 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the
 10 26 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019 (FY 2019=2020).

  8 33 jointly calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.
  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,
  8 35 is applied to the amount of the state general fund expenditure
  9  1 limitation for the prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).
  9  2 The lesser amount identified by the two methods is required to
  9  3 be used as the state general fund expenditure limitation in the
  9  4 budget process for the following fiscal year.
  9  5    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  6 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9  7 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9  8 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9  9 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 10 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 11 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 14 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 15 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 16 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 17 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 18 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 19 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 20 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 21 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the
  9 24 fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or transfers
  9 25 made by the general assembly for tax relief and for temporary
  9 26 cash flow purposes.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 28 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 29 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 30 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
  9 31 education, employment, health, human services, and other
  9 32 programs to aid individuals and families with low income.
  9 33    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
  9 34 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
  9 35 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  1 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  2 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  3 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10  4    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10  5 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10  6 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10  7 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10  8 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10  9    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 10 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 11 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 12 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 13 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 14 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 15 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 16 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 17 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 18 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 19 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 20 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 21 January 1, 2020, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 22 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 23    The bill takes effect July 1, 2019. However, the provisions
 10 24 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 25 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the

  8 24 for the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved
  8 25 by the revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by
  8 26 December 15. The new calculation method in the bill is based
  8 27 on the growth in the average wage and salary component of the

  8 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 14    This bill relates to the state general fund expenditure
  8 15 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 16 limitation, creating a safety net fund, creating an Iowa
  8 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, making transfers,
  8 18 and providing for related state personal income tax rate
  8 19 reductions.
  8 20    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 21 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 22 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law,
  8 23 the limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate
  8 24 for the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved
  8 25 by the revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by
  8 26 December 15. The new calculation method in the bill is based
  8 27 on the growth in the average wage and salary component of the
  8 28 quarterly state personal income table for Iowa issued by the
  8 29 bureau of economic analysis of the United States department of
  8 30 commerce.  Under the new method, the department of management
  8 31 and the legislative services agency are directed to apply the
  8 32 component issued for the quarters of a two=year period to
  8 33 jointly calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.
  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,
  8 35 is applied to the amount of the state general fund expenditure
  9  1 limitation for the prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).
  9  2 The lesser amount identified by the two methods is required to
  9  3 be used as the state general fund expenditure limitation in the
  9  4 budget process for the following fiscal year.
  9  5    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  6 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9  7 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9  8 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9  9 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 10 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 11 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 14 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 15 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 16 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 17 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 18 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 19 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 20 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 21 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the
  9 24 fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or transfers
  9 25 made by the general assembly for tax relief and for temporary
  9 26 cash flow purposes.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 28 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 29 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 30 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
  9 31 education, employment, health, human services, and other
  9 32 programs to aid individuals and families with low income.
  9 33    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
  9 34 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
  9 35 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  1 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  2 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  3 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10  4    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10  5 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10  6 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10  7 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10  8 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10  9    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 10 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 11 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of

 10 25 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the

  8 31 and the legislative services agency are directed to apply the

  8 33 jointly calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.
  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,

  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code

  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the

  9 25 made by the general assembly for tax relief and for temporary
  9 26 cash flow purposes.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 28 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 29 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 30 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
  9 31 education, employment, health, human services, and other
  9 32 programs to aid individuals and families with low income.
  9 33    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
  9 34 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
  9 35 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  1 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  2 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  3 negotiations under Code chapter 20.

 10  5 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10  6 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10  7 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10  8 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10  9    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 10 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 11 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of

 10 13 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 14 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 15 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 16 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 17 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 18 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 19 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 20 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 21 January 1, 2020, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 22 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 23    The bill takes effect July 1, 2019. However, the provisions
 10 24 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 25 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the

  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,

  8 24 for the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved
  8 25 by the revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by
  8 26 December 15. The new calculation method in the bill is based
  8 27 on the growth in the average wage and salary component of the
  8 28 quarterly state personal income table for Iowa issued by the
  8 29 bureau of economic analysis of the United States department of
  8 30 commerce.  Under the new method, the department of management
  8 31 and the legislative services agency are directed to apply the
  8 32 component issued for the quarters of a two=year period to
  8 33 jointly calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.
  8 34 One=half of this percentage amount, combined with 100 percent,
  8 35 is applied to the amount of the state general fund expenditure
  9  1 limitation for the prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).
  9  2 The lesser amount identified by the two methods is required to
  9  3 be used as the state general fund expenditure limitation in the
  9  4 budget process for the following fiscal year.
  9  5    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  6 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9  7 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9  8 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9  9 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 10 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 11 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 14 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 15 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 16 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 17 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 18 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 19 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 20 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 21 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the
  9 24 fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or transfers
  9 25 made by the general assembly for tax relief and for temporary
  9 26 cash flow purposes.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 28 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 29 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 30 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
  9 31 education, employment, health, human services, and other
  9 32 programs to aid individuals and families with low income.
  9 33    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
  9 34 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
  9 35 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  1 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  2 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  3 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10  4    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10  5 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10  6 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10  7 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10  8 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10  9    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 10 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 11 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 12 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 13 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 14 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 15 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 16 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 17 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 18 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 19 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 20 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning

  9  6 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9  7 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9  8 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9  9 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 10 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 11 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 12 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 13 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 14 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 15 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety

  9 21 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 22    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 23 reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys in the
