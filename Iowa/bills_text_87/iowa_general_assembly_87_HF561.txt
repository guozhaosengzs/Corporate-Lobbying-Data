  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates both to a requirement that certain
  2 31 postsecondary schools register with and be approved by the
  2 32 college student aid commission, and to student eligibility for
  2 33 state student financial aid programs.
  2 34    Code chapter 261B requires certain postsecondary schools
  2 35 to register with the commission in order to operate in
  3  1 Iowa or otherwise offer its programs to Iowa residents.
  3  2 Currently, the commission may deny registration and the
  3  3 authorization to operate in Iowa to a school that fails to
  3  4 meet registration criteria or provides false, misleading, or
  3  5 incomplete information in connection with its application
  3  6 for registration. The bill authorizes the commission to
  3  7 also deny, suspend, or revoke a school's registration if
  3  8 the school engaged in conduct prohibited under Code section
  3  9 261B.13.  Currently, Code section 261B.13 prohibits a
  3 10 postsecondary school from operating in this state if the
  3 11 school does not qualify for an exemption and is not accredited
  3 12 by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. department
  3 13 of education.  Code section 261B.13 also prohibits a school
  3 14 that is registered or otherwise authorized to operate in this
  3 15 state from entering into an agreement to conduct a course of
  3 16 instruction, confer a degree, or conduct any other aspect of
  3 17 its operation with another school that is in violation of the
  3 18 Code section.
  3 19    The bill authorizes the commission to grant provisional
  3 20 registration for not more than two years to a school if the
  3 21 school is accredited elsewhere and is seeking the authorization
  3 22 of the accrediting agency or organization to provide programs
  3 23 in Iowa under that accreditation.
  3 24    Under the bill, lists and information submitted under the
  3 25 Code chapter are public records. The bill strikes a provision
  3 26 requiring approved schools to include on written disclosures
  3 27 provided to students, prior to the commencement of classes and
  3 28 receipt of tuition or fees, a statement that the information
  3 29 disclosed is provided in compliance with Code section 261B.9.
  3 30    A Code provision making students who are attending schools
  3 31 that are required to register with the commission ineligible
  3 32 for state student financial aid programs is, under the bill,
  3 33 inapplicable to students attending a for=profit accredited
  3 34 private institution, as defined for purposes of the Iowa
  3 35 tuition grant.
  4  1 Currently, a school required to register with the commission
  4  2 is prohibited from offering state aid or advertising that state
  4  3 aid is or may be available to students attending the school.

  2 30    This bill relates both to a requirement that certain
  2 31 postsecondary schools register with and be approved by the
  2 32 college student aid commission, and to student eligibility for
  2 33 state student financial aid programs.
  2 34    Code chapter 261B requires certain postsecondary schools
  2 35 to register with the commission in order to operate in
  3  1 Iowa or otherwise offer its programs to Iowa residents.
  3  2 Currently, the commission may deny registration and the
  3  3 authorization to operate in Iowa to a school that fails to
  3  4 meet registration criteria or provides false, misleading, or
  3  5 incomplete information in connection with its application
  3  6 for registration. The bill authorizes the commission to
  3  7 also deny, suspend, or revoke a school's registration if
  3  8 the school engaged in conduct prohibited under Code section
  3  9 261B.13.  Currently, Code section 261B.13 prohibits a
  3 10 postsecondary school from operating in this state if the
  3 11 school does not qualify for an exemption and is not accredited
  3 12 by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. department
  3 13 of education.  Code section 261B.13 also prohibits a school
  3 14 that is registered or otherwise authorized to operate in this
  3 15 state from entering into an agreement to conduct a course of
  3 16 instruction, confer a degree, or conduct any other aspect of
  3 17 its operation with another school that is in violation of the
  3 18 Code section.
  3 19    The bill authorizes the commission to grant provisional
  3 20 registration for not more than two years to a school if the
  3 21 school is accredited elsewhere and is seeking the authorization
  3 22 of the accrediting agency or organization to provide programs
  3 23 in Iowa under that accreditation.
  3 24    Under the bill, lists and information submitted under the
  3 25 Code chapter are public records. The bill strikes a provision
  3 26 requiring approved schools to include on written disclosures
  3 27 provided to students, prior to the commencement of classes and
  3 28 receipt of tuition or fees, a statement that the information
  3 29 disclosed is provided in compliance with Code section 261B.9.
  3 30    A Code provision making students who are attending schools
  3 31 that are required to register with the commission ineligible
  3 32 for state student financial aid programs is, under the bill,
  3 33 inapplicable to students attending a for=profit accredited
  3 34 private institution, as defined for purposes of the Iowa
  3 35 tuition grant.

  4  2 is prohibited from offering state aid or advertising that state
  4  3 aid is or may be available to students attending the school.
