  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 26 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 27 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best
  5  4 interest of the student athlete and without undue influence of
  5  5 the school district or accredited nonpublic school or coaching
  5  6 staff employed by the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5  7 school.
  5  8    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  5  9 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  5 10 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  5 11 injuries or damages arising out of such care so long as the
  5 12 licensed health care provider acts reasonably and in good faith
  5 13 and in the best interest of the student athlete and without
  5 14 undue influence of the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5 15 school or coaching staff employed by the school district or
  5 16 accredited nonpublic school.
  5 17    9.  Recommendations.  The advisory council on brain
  5 18 injuries established pursuant to section 135.22A shall make
  5 19 recommendations to the governor on the prevention, diagnosis,
  5 20 and treatment of brain injuries in student athletes, including
  5 21 baseline and post=concussion testing and diagnosis of student
  5 22 athletes, return=to=play and return=to=learn guidelines,
  5 23 training for school educators, coaches, athletic directors,
  5 24 and athletic trainers, delivery of post=concussive management
  5 25 services, and ways to integrate education, training, and
  5 26 diagnostic programs into school programs.
  5 27    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  5 28 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  5 29 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  5 30 training.
  5 31    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5 32 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5 33 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5 34 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5 35 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  6  1 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  6  2 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  6  3 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  6  4 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  6  5 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  6  6 school districts.

  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.

  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic

  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.

  5 17    9.  Recommendations.  The advisory council on brain
  5 18 injuries established pursuant to section 135.22A shall make
  5 19 recommendations to the governor on the prevention, diagnosis,
  5 20 and treatment of brain injuries in student athletes, including

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 26 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 27 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 26 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 27 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best
  5  4 interest of the student athlete and without undue influence of
  5  5 the school district or accredited nonpublic school or coaching
  5  6 staff employed by the school district or accredited nonpublic

  5 15 school or coaching staff employed by the school district or
  5 16 accredited nonpublic school.
  5 17    9.  Recommendations.  The advisory council on brain
  5 18 injuries established pursuant to section 135.22A shall make

  5 24 and athletic trainers, delivery of post=concussive management
  5 25 services, and ways to integrate education, training, and
  5 26 diagnostic programs into school programs.

  5 28 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  5 29 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  5 30 training.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 26 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 27 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best
  5  4 interest of the student athlete and without undue influence of
  5  5 the school district or accredited nonpublic school or coaching
  5  6 staff employed by the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5  7 school.
  5  8    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  5  9 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  5 10 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  5 11 injuries or damages arising out of such care so long as the
  5 12 licensed health care provider acts reasonably and in good faith
  5 13 and in the best interest of the student athlete and without
  5 14 undue influence of the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5 15 school or coaching staff employed by the school district or
  5 16 accredited nonpublic school.
  5 17    9.  Recommendations.  The advisory council on brain
  5 18 injuries established pursuant to section 135.22A shall make
  5 19 recommendations to the governor on the prevention, diagnosis,
  5 20 and treatment of brain injuries in student athletes, including
  5 21 baseline and post=concussion testing and diagnosis of student
  5 22 athletes, return=to=play and return=to=learn guidelines,
  5 23 training for school educators, coaches, athletic directors,
  5 24 and athletic trainers, delivery of post=concussive management
  5 25 services, and ways to integrate education, training, and
  5 26 diagnostic programs into school programs.
  5 27    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  5 28 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  5 29 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  5 30 training.
  5 31    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5 32 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5 33 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5 34 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5 35 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  6  1 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  6  2 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  6  3 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  6  4 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school

  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best
  5  4 interest of the student athlete and without undue influence of
  5  5 the school district or accredited nonpublic school or coaching
  5  6 staff employed by the school district or accredited nonpublic

  5 25 services, and ways to integrate education, training, and
  5 26 diagnostic programs into school programs.
  5 27    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  5 28 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  5 29 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 26 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 27 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best
  5  4 interest of the student athlete and without undue influence of
  5  5 the school district or accredited nonpublic school or coaching
  5  6 staff employed by the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5  7 school.
  5  8    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  5  9 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic

  5 11 injuries or damages arising out of such care so long as the
  5 12 licensed health care provider acts reasonably and in good faith
  5 13 and in the best interest of the student athlete and without
  5 14 undue influence of the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5 15 school or coaching staff employed by the school district or
  5 16 accredited nonpublic school.
  5 17    9.  Recommendations.  The advisory council on brain
  5 18 injuries established pursuant to section 135.22A shall make

  5 23 training for school educators, coaches, athletic directors,
  5 24 and athletic trainers, delivery of post=concussive management
  5 25 services, and ways to integrate education, training, and
  5 26 diagnostic programs into school programs.
  5 27    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  5 28 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  5 29 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  5 30 training.

  6  2 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  6  3 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional

  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 26 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 27 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best
  5  4 interest of the student athlete and without undue influence of
  5  5 the school district or accredited nonpublic school or coaching
  5  6 staff employed by the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5  7 school.
  5  8    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  5  9 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  5 10 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  5 11 injuries or damages arising out of such care so long as the
  5 12 licensed health care provider acts reasonably and in good faith
  5 13 and in the best interest of the student athlete and without
  5 14 undue influence of the school district or accredited nonpublic
  5 15 school or coaching staff employed by the school district or
  5 16 accredited nonpublic school.
  5 17    9.  Recommendations.  The advisory council on brain
  5 18 injuries established pursuant to section 135.22A shall make
  5 19 recommendations to the governor on the prevention, diagnosis,
  5 20 and treatment of brain injuries in student athletes, including

  5 22 athletes, return=to=play and return=to=learn guidelines,
  5 23 training for school educators, coaches, athletic directors,
  5 24 and athletic trainers, delivery of post=concussive management
  5 25 services, and ways to integrate education, training, and
  5 26 diagnostic programs into school programs.
  5 27    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  5 28 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  5 29 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  5 30 training.
  5 31    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5 32 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5 33 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5 34 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5 35 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  6  1 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  6  2 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  6  3 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional

  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.

  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.

  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic

  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best

  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2 10    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game or
  2 11 competition.
  2 12    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2 13 other official in an athletic contest who is registered with
  2 14 the Iowa high school athletic association or the Iowa girls
  2 15 high school athletic union.
  2 16    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 17 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 18 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 19    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 20 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 21 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 22 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 23    3.  Training.
  2 24    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 25 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 26 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 27 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 28 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 34 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 35 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  3  1 of such completion.
  3  2    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  3  6 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  7 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 33 provides a licensed health care provider at a contest shall
  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health
  5  3 care provider acts reasonably and in good faith and in the best
  5  4 interest of the student athlete and without undue influence of
  5  5 the school district or accredited nonpublic school or coaching
  5  6 staff employed by the school district or accredited nonpublic

  5 15 school or coaching staff employed by the school district or
  5 16 accredited nonpublic school.

  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn

  5 23 training for school educators, coaches, athletic directors,
  5 24 and athletic trainers, delivery of post=concussive management
  5 25 services, and ways to integrate education, training, and
  5 26 diagnostic programs into school programs.
  5 27    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  5 28 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted

  5 35 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  6  1 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  6  2 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  6  3 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional

  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.

  2 29 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the

  3  3    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  3  4 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  3  5 union shall work together to distribute the centers for

  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by

  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and
  3 20 return a copy of the concussion and brain injury information
  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,

  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that

  4 34 not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon
  4 35 the actions or inactions of the licensed health care provider
  5  1 present at the contest at the request of the school district
  5  2 or accredited nonpublic school so long as the licensed health

  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 brain injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete
  1 33 thinks, acts, feels, and learns. A student athlete who has
  1 34 sustained a concussion may need informal or formal adjustments,
  1 35 accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring
  2  1 by medical or educational staff until the student is fully
  2  2 recovered. To that end, the department of public health, in
  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association
  2  4 and the Iowa girls high school athletic union, shall establish
  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
  2  6 protocol that is based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence
  2  7 consistent with federal guidelines. Furthermore, all schools
  2  8 in this state shall adopt such protocols.
  2  9    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:

  2 30 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 31 every two years.
  2 32    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 33 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the

  3  8 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  9 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3 10 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3 11 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3 12 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3 13 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3 14    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school
  3 15 shall provide to the parent or guardian of each student a
  3 16 concussion and brain injury information sheet, as provided by
  3 17 the department of public health, the Iowa high school athletic
  3 18 association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic union.
  3 19 The student and the student's parent or guardian shall sign and

  3 21 sheet to the student's school prior to the student's
  3 22 participation in any extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  3 23    5.  Removal from participation.
  3 24    a.  If a student's coach, contest official, or licensed
  3 25 health care provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors
  3 26 consistent with a concussion or brain injury in an
  3 27 extracurricular interscholastic activity, the student shall be
  3 28 immediately removed from participation.
  3 29    b.  A student who has been removed from participation shall
  3 30 not recommence such participation until the student has been
  3 31 evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the
  3 32 evaluation and management of concussions and other brain
  3 33 injuries and the student has received written clearance to
  3 34 return to participation from the licensed health care provider.
  3 35    6.  Return=to=play and return=to=learn protocols.  The
  4  1 department of public health, the department of education, the
  4  2 Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa girls
  4  3 high school athletic union shall work together to develop
  4  4 a return=to=play protocol and a return=to=learn protocol,
  4  5 based on peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with the
  4  6 guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention
  4  7 of the United States department of health and human services,
  4  8 for a student's return to participation in an extracurricular
  4  9 interscholastic activity and in the classroom after showing
  4 10 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  4 11 or brain injury. The board of directors of each school
  4 12 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 13 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate in an
  4 14 extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a contest in
  4 15 grades seven through twelve shall adopt such protocols.
  4 16    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4 17 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4 18 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4 19 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4 20 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4 21 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4 22 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4 23 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 24 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 25 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 26 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 27 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 28 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 29 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 30    8.  Liability.
  4 31    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 32 fully implements the protocols required by this section and

  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play or expected
  1 28 to learn at full capability, resulting in prolonged symptoms,
  1 29 actual or potential physical injury, or death to youth athletes
  1 30 in this state.
  1 31    d.  A concussion can impair not only the physical abilities
  1 32 of a student athlete, but can also affect how a student athlete

  2  3 coordination with the Iowa high school athletic association

  2  5 and disseminate to all schools in this state a return=to=learn
